			In Search of God''s Love



			Our Responsibility to seek God''s Love:

			One can only imagine the weight of responsibility that Moroni felt as he
			saw that the Nephite kingdom was about to be destroyed. He wrote
			words that he knew would lay hidden in the ground for centuries, and
			wrote them lovingly for a people he had only seen in prophetic
			vision. Yet knowing that the eternal impact of his words would be
			tremendous, he wrote to our generation in great anxiety of heart. One
			need only imagine oneself in Moroni''s position. What would be
			the words we would write to our posterity, having seen them, knowing
			their hearts, and having seen their desires? And how would we
			conclude our words, knowing that they would be the last not only to
			fall from our pen, but would be the final monument to the thousand
			year documentation of the spiritual lives of a great people? More
			immediately, what would we tell our children as they knelt beside our
			death bed? What would be the last words that fell from our mouths-the
			words that would matter most, and would ring in the ears of our
			children throughout their lives?

			Moroni concludes his work, and the work of a millennium of his ancestors,
			with the following admonitions: "Yea, come unto Christ, and be
			perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye
			shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your
			might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that
			by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God
			ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God. And
			again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not
			his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God,
			through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant
			of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy,
			without spot.
			And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of
			God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought
			forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar
			of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead.
			Amen." Moroni 10:32-34

			Moroni''s concluding words are what I refer to as "Holographic
			Verse". A hologram is a three dimensional picture of some
			object. Its special properties allow it to contain in every tiny
			picture element, information about the entire image. If a painting of
			a rose were torn into bits, we''d have many pieces that depicted
			various parts of a rose. One bit may show a fragment of stem, another
			a thorn, another some background, or a petal, or a vase, etc. Alone
			any element would be insufficient to show us that the original
			painting had been of a single rose. If a holographic rendering of a
			rose were dashed to pieces, however, we''d have innumerable
			fragments that all represent the entire rose, seen from a particular
			point of view. One fragment may be a representation as if we viewed
			the flower from above, another from one side, etc. Moroni''s
			final words contain a near complete blue-print for God''s plan
			for our happiness. Like a hologram, this complete picture of
			salvation is viewed from a particular vantage point-a Nephit prophet
			near the end of his life, writing to a people who wouldn''t be
			born for over 1,500 years, but a complete view. Distilled into
			it''s basic elements, the view of God''s plan for us is as
			follows:
			1- Be perfected in Christ, including overcoming sinfulness
			2- Love God
			3- Through obedience and God''s love (which may a synonym for the
			commonly used word "Grace"), we''re sanctified, or made
			holy, through the blood of Christ, or his atonement
			4- A reuniting will occur-a resurrection-- joining the body and spirit,
			and in this resurrected body we''ll join the ones we love.

			Note in the above formula the role that love plays. Throughout history
			man has tried to reach heaven through his works. The ancient
			Babylonians built a tower to reach God, their Hebrew brothers created
			intricate and confusing laws, and among every infidel people there
			seems to have arise some distortion of the law of sacrifice, as if
			this alone would justify us in our sins.

			At the other end of the Book of Mormon, almost 1,000 years earlier,
			another prophet explains the simple and pure formula by which Eternal
			Life is achieved: "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a
			steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a
			love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward,
			feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus
			saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.
			"And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none
			other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the
			kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and
			the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
			Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen." (2 Nephi
			31:20,21) The love of God and all men are the persistent requirements
			by which men may stand in the presence of their Eternal Father. And
			we may ask, how has this requirement been established? Surely God
			loves us. This is plain and manifest throughout the scriptures. But
			why has he placed such a premium on our returned love for him, and by
			extension, on our love of our fellow men?


			D&C121: 45, 46 Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and
			to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts
			unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of
			God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as
			the dews from heaven.
			46 The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an
			unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall
			be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall
			flow unto thee forever and ever.


			In his letter to the Galatians, Paul breaks the hologram of the plan of
			salvation into even smaller pieces, and holding up one tiny fragment
			distils all the law and the prophets into a single word: "For
			all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love
			thy neighbour as thyself." Galatians5:14 Now many consider that
			this law of love is a product of Christ''s mortal ministry, and
			is only found in the New Testament. Yet the law of love was clearly
			given to the Israelites on Mount Sinai. The very first of the 10
			commandments, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me", is
			a clear command to love God. In the Book of Deuteronomy (a word
			translated as "the repeated law", indicating that the
			people had heard it earlier) we read: "And thou shalt love the
			LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with
			all thy might." (Deuteronomy6:5).

			Like Moroni''s holographic fragment of the plan of Salvation, the
			Israelites are given the same plan: "And now, Israel, what doth
			the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to
			walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God
			with all thy heart and with all thy soul, To keep the commandments of
			the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy
			good?" Deut10:12,13 The formula:
			1- Fear God (a synonym for loving Him)
			2- Obey his commandments and serve Him

			After 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, and after the Lord had
			either destroyed or allowed to expire from old age the original host
			of Israel which had fled Egypt, but which couldn''t leave her
			behind, it was time to enter the promised land. Standing at the brink
			of their promised blessing, the younger, and now softer hearted host
			of Israel were once again instructed of the Lord as to those things
			that would be required of them to posses and retain this great
			blessing. Moses exhorts, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is
			one LORD: And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart,
			and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." Deut 6: 4,5

			To Joseph Knight Sr., the Lord clearly taught, "And no one can
			assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love,
			having faith, hope, and charity, being temperate in all things,
			whatsoever shall be entrusted to his care." D&C12:8

			Sacrifice

			The willful exchange of something we acknowledge has earthly value for
			something that we hope has eternal value.

			There is no righteous sacrifice that doesn''t lead us directly to the
			atonement of the Savior. From the firstlings of the flock to a
			grateful payment of tithing, all righteous sacrifice leads us to the
			great and final sacrifice-final not because man would never be asked
			to give again, but because it is the only sacrifice that will have
			power to break the bands of death.

			The Atonement of Jesus Christ

			D&C138:1 "On the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and
			eighteen, I sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;" So
			begins this writing of the Prophet Joseph F. Smith. And so I begin
			tonight, alone in a hotel room, pondering this most important
			subject-God''s Love. "And reflecting upon the great atoning
			sacrifice that was made by the Son of God, for the redemption of the
			world; 3 And the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father
			and the Son in the coming of the Redeemer into the world;
			4 That through his atonement, and by obedience to the principles of
			the gospel, mankind might be saved. (D&C138:2-4) And so in the
			beginning of the search I seem to stumble upon the end of the search,
			only to begin again. The answer to God''s love is in the
			atonement of Jesus Christ for each of us. This is the foundation for
			any understanding of God''s love-how he has manifested it for us,
			and how we find it in our own hearts to share with others.

			Moroni10:32 Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny
			yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all
			ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength,
			then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be
			perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in
			Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.
			33 And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny
			not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God,
			through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant
			of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy,
			without spot.
			34 And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise
			of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am
			brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the
			pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick
			and dead. Amen.

			To Latter-day Saints, it''s an Article of Faith: "We believe
			that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by
			obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel." Christ is
			the way. We are only saved through his atoning sacrifice.

			Love''s chief manifestation is seen in the grace of God as this is found in
			the infinite and eternal atonement. "For God so loved the world,
			that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
			should not perish, but have everlasting life." (John 3:16; D.
			& C. 34:3.) (Mormon Doctrine, Bruce R. McConkie, p. 459)

			In the winter of 1832, the young prophet Joseph and his companion
			Sidney Rigdon knelt in prayer and a vision of the eternities were
			open to them. In this great moment they experienced, not as if
			through hearing a recounting, but through their own experience, the
			kingdoms of glory, the plan of salvation, and the mission of the
			Savior upon the earth. In words far from equal to the light opened to
			their eyes they explain: "And this is the gospel, the glad
			tidings, which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us-That
			he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world,
			and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to
			cleanse it from all unrighteousness; That through him all might be
			saved whom the Father had put into his power and made by him;"
			D&C76:40-42 And in these simple words that we find it simple to
			explain to tiny children the whole and complexity of our existence is
			made clear. The good news or glad tidings, the point of our
			existence, the very gospel, is this: that we, God''s children,
			might be saved.

			D&C18:11,12 "For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the
			flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might
			repent and come unto him.
			12 And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men
			unto him, on conditions of repentance."

			D&C45:3-5 Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading
			your cause before him-
			4 Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no
			sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son
			which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might
			be glorified;
			5 Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name,
			that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.


			D&C38:4 I am the same which have taken the Zion of Enoch into mine own
			bosom; and verily, I say, even as many as have believed in my name,
			for I am Christ, and in mine own name, by the virtue of the blood
			which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the Father for them.

			Perhaps the most condemning words ever spoken of a man were those
			spoken by Joseph Smith of his friend, companion, and fellow disciple,
			Sidney Rigdon. The Prophet said, "Brother Sidney is a man whom I
			love, but he is not capable of that pure and steadfast love for those
			who are his benefactors that should characterize a President of the
			Church of Christ." (Joseph Fielding Smith, Church History and
			Modern Revelation, 4 vols. [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus
			Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1946-1949], 3: 7.)
			Sidney Rigdon''s faults echo of the man Paul describes to the
			Corinthians: "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of
			angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a
			tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and
			understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all
			faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
			nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and
			though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
			profiteth me nothing." (1Corinthians 13:1-3). Indeed, the early
			history of the Church was replete with those who would willingly
			sacrifice time, comfort, worldly things, even their own lives, but
			who did so without the pure and steadfast love-charity-which Joseph
			describes here.

			God''s love in sorrow:
			1 Peter 4:12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial
			which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:
			13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ''s
			sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad
			also with exceeding joy.

			1 Peter 4: 15 "But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a
			thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men''s
			matters.
			16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but
			let him glorify God on this behalf." In other words, herein
			Peter makes a distinction between that suffering which we incur
			because of our own evil-doing, and that suffering which comes from
			being one with Christ. To suffer for our own flesh is a consequence
			of our giving into temptation. To suffer because of the Love of God
			which is in us brings us unto God.

			Paul, seeing the suffering of the early saints, explains to the followers
			in Corinth, "For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation
			not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh
			death." 2 Corinthians 7:10

			And again, Mormon, sees the suffering of his own people, and at first
			sees great hope in their travail, but then see that their affliction
			has taken them down the wrong path.


			"And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their lamentation and their
			mourning and their sorrow before the Lord, my heart did begin to
			rejoice within me, knowing the mercies and the long-suffering of the
			Lord, therefore supposing that he would be merciful unto them that
			they would again become a righteous people.
			13 But behold this my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not unto
			repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was rather the
			sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer
			them to take happiness in sin. (Mormon 2:12,13)

			But what of we Latter-day Saints today who strive to do the Lord''s
			will? What of us who may not be guilty of committing any grevious
			sin, who''s hearts and hands are free from murderings and
			adultery, but who remain far from being perfect, as we have been
			commanded to become? Where does our suffering bring us?

			The same question could be asked of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who''s
			life, by his own admission, was imperfect, yet who reached out and
			grasped more godly knowledge and power than any other in this
			dispensation. Where did his many afflictions bring him? The answer
			seems clear-the sufferings of righteous men bring them to greater
			righteousness, to greater patience, greater humility, greater faith,
			and endurance, to more gratitude for every gift they receive, and to
			an expanded capacity for joy. Joseph Smith described himself: "I
			am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and
			the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by
			coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated
			force against religious bigotry, priestcraft, lawyer-craft,
			doctor-craft, lying editors, suborned judges and jurors, and the
			authority of perjured executives, backed by mobs, blasphemers,
			licentious and corrupt men and women-all hell knocking off a corner
			here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished
			shaft in the quiver of the Almighty, who will give me dominion over
			all and every one of them, when their refuge of lies shall fail, and
			their hiding place shall be destroyed, while these smooth-polished
			stones with which I come in contact become marred" (Teachings of
			the Prophet Joseph Smith, 304).

			Perhaps the Apostle Paul explained it most succinctly to the early saints in
			Rome: "And we know that all things work together for good to
			them that love God, to them who are the called according to his
			purpose." Romans 8:28



			"As bad as it can get, there is the assurance that there is purpose,
			that trials come to all God''s followers for their benefit, and
			that weeping endures only for a night for "joy cometh in the
			morning" (Ps. 30:5).
			The joy will often come not only because the trial is over but also
			because we know that with God''s help we have passed the test. If
			joy were dependent on the end of trials, we would often be
			disappointed, for the parade of problems continues; when one trial is
			done there is another around the proverbial corner." (Elaine
			Cannon, Adversity [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1987], 44.)







			Charity or Pure Love defined:
			The Apostle Paul defines Charity thusly: "Charity suffereth long,
			and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not
			puffed up,
			Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily
			provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth
			in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all
			things, endureth all things." (1 Corinthians 13:4-7)

			Moroni, perhaps quoting from the same ancient text as Paul, or inspired by
			the same spirit, gives much the same definition of Charity, and then
			defines it in its simplest terms: "And again, behold I say unto
			you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and
			lowly of heart. If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is
			acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart; and if a man
			be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy
			Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he
			have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.
			And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not
			puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no
			evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth,
			beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
			all things. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity,
			ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto
			charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail-But
			charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and
			whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with
			him." (Moroni7:43-47).

			Charity, purely and simply defined, is the pure love of Christ. The ancient
			prophets knew it. The Modern prophets have known it. Godly men and
			women have known and embraced this solemn truth.

			The Relationship of righteous sacrifice to love

			Service

			Love is always associated with and manifest through service. "Thou
			shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might,
			mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve
			him. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." (D. & C.
			59:5-6.) "If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my
			commandments." (D. & C. 42:29; John 14:15.) (Bruce R.
			McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, p. 459)
			In the book, "Love", President Ezra Taft Benson teaches,
			"The secret of a happy marriage is to serve God and each other.
			The goal of marriage is unity and oneness, as well as
			self-development. Paradoxically, the more we serve one another, the
			greater is our spiritual and emotional growth." (Love; various
			General Authorities; p. 3)

			Obedience
			Alma taught his son Shiblon, Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also
			see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with
			love; see that ye refrain from idleness. (Alma 38:12)

			Making Charity Happen
			In his April 2002 General Conference address, Elder Gene R. Cook makes
			the following recommendations to those who would see to find charity
			in their lives:
			1. Recognize His love. "Pray . . . with all the energy of
			heart" for this gift. Do so in meekness with a broken heart, and
			you will be filled with hope and love from the Holy Ghost Himself. He
			will reveal Christ to you.
			2. Receive His love in humility. Be grateful for the gift and
			especially for the giver of the gift. True gratitude is the ability
			to humbly see, feel, and even receive love. Gratitude is a form of
			returning love to God. Recognize His hand, tell Him so, express your
			love to Him. As you come to truly know the Lord, you will find an
			intimate, sacred relationship built on trust. You will come to know
			He understands your anguish and will, in compassion, always respond
			to you in love.
			3. Convey His love. The Lord''s response to us is always filled
			with love. Should not our response to Him be in kind, with real
			feelings of love? He gives grace (or goodness) for grace, attribute
			for attribute. As our obedience increases, we receive more grace (or
			goodness) for the grace we return to Him. Offer Him the refinement of
			your attributes, so that when He does appear you will be like Him.


			Repentance

			D&C18:11-13 "11 For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the
			flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might
			repent and come unto him.
			12 And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men
			unto him, on conditions of repentance.
			13 And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!


			"And of tenets thou shalt not talk, but thou shalt declare repentance and
			faith on the Savior, and remission of sins by baptism, and by fire,
			yea, even the Holy Ghost.
			Behold, this is a great and the last commandment which I shall give unto you
			concerning this matter; for this shall suffice for thy daily walk,
			even unto the end of thy life." D&C19:31,32

			Moroni 8:25, 26 And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism
			cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the
			fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins; 26 And the
			remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and
			because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of
			the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love,
			which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall
			come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.


			The Holy Ghost

			John14: 26,27 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
			will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all
			things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
			27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world
			giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let
			it be afraid.

			John15: 26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
			the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the
			Father, he shall testify of me;

			Moroni 8:25, 26 And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism
			cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the
			fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins; 26 And the
			remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and
			because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of
			the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love,
			which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall
			come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.

			Relationship with the Savior

			John 15:4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
			itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide
			in me. 5 I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me,
			and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye
			can do nothing.
			6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
			withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
			are burned.

			Meekness and Gratitude


			Keeping the Commandments
			John15:10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I
			have kept my Father''s commandments, and abide in his love.

			Psalms 19: The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
			testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
			8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
			commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
			9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of
			the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
			10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
			sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
			11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there
			is great reward.

			The members of the Church who keep the commandments have this promise:
			"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall
			tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
			peril, or sword? . . . Nay, in all these things we are more than
			conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded" - Paul
			is speaking - "that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
			principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
			nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
			separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
			Lord" (Rom. 8:35-39.) (Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, p.
			460)

			Synonyms for God''s Love

			Joy
			JST John 15:11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might
			remain in you, and that your joy might be full.

			2Nephi2:25 Adam fell…

			Grace
			"Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of
			all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness,
			and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his
			grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in
			Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can
			in nowise deny the power of God." And again, if ye by the grace
			of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye
			sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the
			blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the
			remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot."
			Moroni10:32,33 32

			Fear
			The word "fear" seems to denote different things in different
			parts of the scriptures. Where it refers to man''s relationship
			with Diety, however, the word often suggests deep love and respect as
			opposed to terror or distrust. The basis of the word
			"fear", in any context, is subjugation or acknowledgement
			of inferiority. A person''s fear of high places, for example, is
			an acknowledgement that the consequences of a misstep from such a
			place will be beyond ones'' control. Such can be said of other
			fears or phobias-they derive from an acknowledgement of inferiority
			to a superior force, imagined or real.

			Man therefore fears God when man is humble enough to admit to himself
			that there''s a greater power in the Universe than himself. As
			inevitable as the consequences of natural laws such as gravity or
			darkness, God''s laws have consequences. The basis of our
			"fear" of God is humility. Unlike other natural laws,
			however, our understanding of heavenly laws grows from an
			understanding that they''re based on a plan to make us happy. The
			sinner may be brought to fear God as he feels remorse for his sins,
			and realizes that eternal misery awaits him as a consequence. But
			this fear, or distrust of God (as if he were an assailant) quickly
			grows within the humbled sinner''s heart as it changes to a fear,
			or love for God who has prepared a plan of repentance and forgiveness
			of sin.

			Consider King Benjamin''s great sermon to his people:

			Mosiah 5:1 "And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made
			an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the
			angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the
			multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of
			the Lord had come upon them." In this verse one could easily
			infer that the people, reminded of their own sinful ways, had fallen
			to the earth because, having seen their own filthiness, they
			literally doubted, and therefore feared, that they would be able to
			gain a celestial reward. Their fall to the ground would in this
			context have been as the victim before the assailant, trembling and
			begging for mercy.

			This thought continues in the next verse: 2 "And they had viewed
			themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the
			earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have
			mercy…" Here we might imagine our helpless, groveling victim.
			But then our perspective changes as the people explain that they have
			great hope, even knowledge, that something better awaits them:
			".and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive
			forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we
			believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and
			earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of
			men." The people, having understood God''s love for them,
			fell to the ground in full faith that they would receive a remission
			of their sins through the atoning blood of Christ.

			This being said, there''s value in rereading the first verse of
			Mosiah 5, now substituting the word "fear" with the idea of
			its intended synonym, "God''s love". We read, "And
			now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of
			speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the angel of
			the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and
			behold they had fallen to the earth, for the [love] of the Lord had
			come upon them." Perhaps the salient question is this: Do the
			Lord''s children respond more meaningfully and powerfully through
			the repellent force of a distrustful fear of their Father, or from a
			humble and respectful love of the same?

			We can substitute this word "love" for "fear" in
			many other verses of scripture. To the children of Israel, wandering
			dependently in the wilderness for 40 years, Moses asks, "And
			now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear
			the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to
			serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, To
			keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command
			thee this day for thy good?" Deut10:12,13 We note in this verse
			the juxtaposition of the commandments to both fear and love the Lord.

			Gratitude
			In his April 2002 Conference Address, Elder Gene R. Cook admonishes us:
			"Receive His [the Lord''s] love in humility. Be grateful for
			the gift and especially for the giver of the gift. True gratitude is
			the ability to humbly see, feel, and even receive love. Gratitude is
			a form of returning love to God. Recognize His hand, tell Him so,
			express your love to Him. As you come to truly know the Lord, you
			will find an intimate, sacred relationship built on trust. You will
			come to know He understands your anguish and will, in compassion,
			always respond to you in love."


			Charity
			Of all synonyms for God''s love, the most comprehensive seems to be
			the word "charity". Bruce R. McConkie explains, "Above
			all the attributes of godliness and perfection, charity is the one
			most devoutly to be desired. Charity is more than love, far more; it
			is everlasting love, perfect love, the pure love of Christ which
			endureth forever. It is love so centered in righteousness that the
			possessor has no aim or desire except for the eternal welfare of his
			own soul and for the souls of those around him. (Mormon Doctrine, p.
			121).

			Moroni 7:46 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are
			nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity,
			which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail-
			47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and
			whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with
			him.
			48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the
			energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath
			bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ;
			that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we
			shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have
			this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.

			2 Nephi 26:30 Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore,
			the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have
			charity, which charity is love. And except they should have charity
			they were nothing. Wherefore, if they should have charity they would
			not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.

			The Spirit of the Lord
			See 1 Nephi 1:12

			The Spirit of Christ
			For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know
			good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for
			every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in
			Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye
			may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God. Moroni 7:16

			The Power and Gift of Christ
			For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know
			good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for
			every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in
			Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye
			may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God. Moroni 7:16

			Mercy

			Grace

			Glory "And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou
			art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh;
			for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the
			way is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation is free." 2
			Nephi 2:4)

			Fountain of Living Waters
			And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father
			had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living
			waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of
			the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a
			representation of the love of God. (1 Nephi 11:25)

			Tree of Life
			And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father
			had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living
			waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of
			the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a
			representation of the love of God. (1 Nephi 11:25)

			Blessed (See the Beatitudes-Matt 5:3-13)

			The Power of God
			I am filled with the power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh
			(1 Nephi 17:48) v. He hath filled me with his love, even unto the
			consuming of my flesh. (2 Nephi 4:21)

			Opposition in all things

			2Nephi2:15 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he
			had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the
			fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must
			needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in
			opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other
			bitter.

			2Nephi 2: 22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not
			have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And
			all things which were created must have remained in the same state in
			which they were after they were created; and they must have remained
			forever, and had no end.
			23 And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have
			remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no
			misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.
			Agency
			2Nephi 2: 15 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man,
			after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field
			and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created,
			it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden
			fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the
			other bitter.
			16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for
			himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be
			that he was enticed by the one or the other.

			Blessings promised to those who love God:
			After wandering 40 years in the Wilderness, Moses brought his people up to
			the edge of their promised land, and gave them instruction. The book
			of Deuteronomy, from which we read an account of these events, is a
			repetition of the Law of God. Moses reminds the people: "For the
			land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of
			Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and
			wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: But the land,
			whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and
			drinketh water of the rain of heaven: A land which the LORD thy God
			careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the
			beginning of the year even unto the end of the year. And it shall
			come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments
			which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve
			him with all your heart and with all your soul,
			That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first
			rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and
			thy wine, and thine oil." Deut11:10-15. In Egypt, the fertile
			soil and flowing river around Goshen made it relatively simple to
			care for oneself. One could simply scatter seeds on the ground, push
			them into the soil, and they would sprout. But this new generation of
			Israelities were to be humble, and were to look to the Lord for their
			support. The rain would fall because they were obedient to him. The
			daily manna of their fathers was to become the seasonal manna of rain
			and sunshine one which they would depend for their very existence.
			The faucet, as it were, to irrigate their land and make it fertile,
			was their love of God.

			Many times the Lord removes those, whom he loves, from an Egypt, where
			they''re captive to their own desires and to the strength of
			their own flesh, and he moves them to a condition wherein they must
			look to Him for their support.

			Love is knowledge, wisdom, and power

			D&C 121:45, 46 Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men,
			and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts
			unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of
			God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as
			the dews from heaven.
			46 The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an
			unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall
			be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall
			flow unto thee forever and ever.

			Miscelaneous

			As I was pondering love today, the following quote caught my attention:
			Love established in the home then extends out to the neighborhood,
			the state, the nation, and the world and has the power to bind people
			together and make them one. "Differences of language, of
			education, of race and of nationality all disappear. Under its
			influence, prejudices and animosities vanish" (Cannon, George Q.
			Gospel Truth p. 299). This comes out of the encyclopedia of Mormonism
			under "love". The reference to language is what struck me,
			and that differences of language will disappear with love. Applying
			this to the Tower of Babel I can''t help but wonder if what
			caused the collapse of the unified language was indeed the
			dissolution of love between the people. I also can''t help but
			wonder if the Adamic language is founded, not on linguistics, but on
			love. Is this where the gift of tongues derives-this Godly love? How
			else can it be explained?

			A Book of Mormon Tour of Godly Love

			This tour explores the Book of Mormon as a historical field guide, of
			sorts, into the understanding of Godly Love. Through every chapter, I
			suppose, there are references, either overtly or implied, that
			demonstrate Godly Love, or the consequences of those who choose to
			turn away from the Lord.


			1 Nephi 1:1 "I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents,
			therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and
			having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless,
			having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having
			had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God,
			therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days."

			Nephi begins his first narrative in the Book of Mormon, which becomes the
			first chapter and verse, by describing the love of parents to
			children, the importance of educating them, the reality of
			afflictions in all of our lives, and the blessings which come as we
			overcome our afflictions, having faith in God, and learning of His
			ways. It begins with open gratitude to his acknowledged Heavenly
			Father for great gifts. It begins with a Godly man, standing within
			himself, yet looking beyond himself:
			· Acknowledgement of Parents
			· Importance of education
			· Overcoming adversity
			· Gratitude to the Lord
			· Learning of the Lord
			· Importance of record keeping

			In fact, the first verse of the Book of Mormon becomes, as it were, a
			type and a shadow for the rest of the book. It also becomes a
			synopsis of what it means to experience Godly Love. This love of a
			Heavenly Father begins in the love of earthly parents who teach and
			nourish us, and moves on to how we use our earthly blessings to bless
			others.

			Within a few verses we come to understand the context of the people who
			would be known as the Nephites-a people born in a tumultuous time in
			the history of Israel-a people who would either leave to escape the
			onslaught of the Babylonians, or who would be conquered and carried
			away by them. And here we find the man Lehi, blessed by the Lord and
			prospering in earthly ways, yet focused outside of himself.

			1 Nephi 1:5. "Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as
			he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in
			behalf of his people." We''ve journeyed only 5 verses into
			the Book of Mormon and we''ve learned the order of love-God to
			his children, children to fathers, and now, man to his brother-the
			human family. It''s not enough to speak of God''s love for
			us, but rather, we must speak of God''s love in us, or through
			us-we being the mirror that immediately reflects God''s light
			onto our brethren.

			In his vision, Lehi is handed a book of scripture to read, and as he
			reads, he''s "filled with the Spirit of the Lord." (1
			Nephi 1:12). We now come upon another synonym for "God''s
			Love", which is "the Spirit of the Lord". If we
			literally accept the Biblical Pronouncement by the Apostle John that
			"God is love" (1 John 4:8), we can use the terms God and
			Love interchangeably. To say that Lehi is filled with the Spirit of
			the Lord is equal to saying he is filled with the Spirit of Love. In
			this way each person who feels the Spirit of the Lord recognizes this
			love in is/her life. John elaborates: "Beloved, let us love one
			another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of
			God, and knoweth God." (1 John 4:7) Being filled with this
			Spirit, or in other words, this Love, it''s no surprise to learn
			what Lehi does next. His heart is turned inside out, as he looks from
			self to his fellow men, and jeapordizes his life to go out and preach
			among them. His heart is filled with gratitude as he turns to the
			lord and exclaims, "Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord
			God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and
			goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and,
			because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto
			thee that they shall perish!" (1 Nephi 1:14) This godly mercy of
			which Lehi speaks is another synonym for the idea of God''s love.
			Nephi explains, "But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that
			the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath
			chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the
			power of deliverance." (1 Nephi 1:20)

			As Lehi continues to be faithful in the charge he''s received to
			warn his fellow men, we read the following: "For behold, it came
			to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and
			said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which
			thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto
			this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to
			take away thy life." 1 Nephi 2:1 This great man has put away
			personal considerations and fears (pride) to do the will of the Lord,
			and for this he''s "blessed". We may well ask, what
			does it mean to be "blessed"? Webster''s 1828
			Dictionary defines the term, in part, as "enjoying spiritual
			happiness and the favor of God; enjoying heavenly felicity".
			This definition is quite insightful. Note that the term doesn''t
			express as much what God has given his children, but rather, their
			recognition and acknowledgement of those gifts. In other words, we
			might well ask, "to whom has the Lord denied gifts that would
			bring them back to him?" What child of God is their upon this
			earth whom the Lord has denied those spiritual and temporal gifts
			that would allow him/her to return to their Heavenly Father? The
			answer, quite simply, is none. Every soul born upon this earth was
			already one of the elect-a victor in the War in Heaven. Every soul is
			born with the same destiny to return and live in a Heavenly Home,
			"For there is no respect of persons with God." Romans 2:11
			The blessed man or woman, therefore, isn''t that soul who has
			received the greatest amount from God, but rather, is that person who
			recognizes God''s gifts in his/her life. The blessed soul
			isn''t he who has received most, for we all receive according to
			our capacity to receive. The blessed soul is that which recognizes
			God''s love and His gifts.

			Consider the Beatitudes in this context (Matthew 5:3-13):
			· Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
			· Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
			· Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
			· Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for
			they shall be filled.
			· Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
			· Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
			· Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children
			of God.
			· Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness'' sake:
			for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
			· Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
			shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
			Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven:
			for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
			In each case, a person is recognized as blessed, not for something the
			Lord has given them, but for something they''ve given back to the
			Lord. In each case the person is blessed who has submitted to the
			will of the Father (is poor in spirit, mourns, is meek, hungers after
			righteousness, is merciful, pure in heart, a peacemaker, is
			persecuted for righteousness'' sake, suffers for the Lord).
			He''s blessed first for what he has submitted himself to, and
			he''s promised blessings afterwards for the consequence of his
			choice (obtains the kingdom of heaven, is comforted, inherits the
			earth, is filled, obtains mercy, sees God, is called a Child of God,
			obtains the kingdom of heaven, receives a great reward in Heaven.)
			Thus, when the Lord pronounces Lehi blessed for his selfless actions,
			we might wonder about this-he must abandon riches, and any reputation
			among men he may have had. He must leave the comfort of a luxurious
			home, and take an often-rebellious family into the wilderness to be
			deprived of a lifestyle many would argue he''d earned. But
			he''s blessed for who he is, having submitted to God''s will,
			feeling God''s love in his life. Lehi is "blessed"
			during the sacrifices he makes, because through these righteous acts
			of submission to God''s will, he feels God''s love.
			Conversely, we might add that any act of self-deprivation that
			doesn''t allow us to feel God''s love at the moment of
			submission probably isn''t a "blessing" to us.
			We''re only blessed in sacrifice as it draws us closer to God and
			allows us to feel his love for and through us.

			So Lehi draws his family together, and in willing submission to
			God''s will, leaves the comfortable life he knew, and departs
			into the wilderness. We know that some of his family has gone through
			the process to believe, and walks with him in faith. Nephi prays, and
			receives a steady answer that his father has indeed been instructed
			of the Lord. Lehi receives the vision, and Nephi confirms it through
			prayer. Then Nephi bears testimony to his brother Sam, who, through
			Nephi''s faith and testimony, gains testimony of the same. But
			Laman and Lemuel are unwilling to submit themselves-unwilling to
			believe. "And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did
			murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they knew
			not the dealings of that God who had created them." (1Nephi2:12)
			They "knew not the dealings…of God." In other words, they
			were unfamiliar with his ways, with his intercession with his
			children, and with his love for them. What faith could they possibly
			have in a being whom they hadn''t come to know. What courage
			would they be able to draw as they left all of their comforts, that
			they''d continue to be happy and watched over? For Nephi, the
			journey into the wilderness was relatively simple. His journey was
			governed by a single great principle, for he did know the dealings of
			God. He knew that at all times, and in every moment, through every
			hardship and trial, he was loved by the only being in the Universe
			who''s feelings really matter.
			We learn from the writings of the prophet Joseph Smith, that
			"Faith, then, is the first great governing principle which has
			power, dominion, and authority over all things; by it they exist, by
			it they are upheld, by it they are changed, or by it they remain,
			agreeable to the will of God." (Lectures on Faith, 1:24.) What
			is faith, then, if not the understanding that God loves us, and seeks
			the best for us? To exercise faith, then, is simply a matter of
			trust, that the Lord will seek out the best for us, and is, in all
			ways, empowered to deliver it to us. Nephi and Lehi had this faith
			through vision, Sam and Sariah had it through their willingness to be
			counseled by Lehi and Nephi. But Laman and Lemuel rejected the
			Lord''s overtures of love, and thus knew now his workings.

			For Nephi, it wasn''t sufficient to gain a testimony of the Gospel
			of Jesus Christ. He wanted to learn more. He wanted to understand the
			"mysteries of God", which I suppose, simply means those
			things that are revealed to an individual through study and prayer.
			He records, "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being
			exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also
			having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I
			did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my
			heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my
			father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my
			brothers." 1 Nephi 2:16 Why did Nephi need to soften his heart,
			and what exactly does the phrase mean? We know that the term has
			something to do with humility, and something to do with being
			teachable.

			The commandment Lehi received to leave all their worldly wealth and go
			to some unseen promised land would have been difficult to obey. But
			for his sons, the commandment to return to their former home, collect
			all of their abandoned wealth, then take it to a man they greatly
			feared in exchange for something which had little earthly value-this
			was a true test. Lehi sent his sons, Laman, Lemuel, Sam and Nephi
			back to Jerusalem to fetch the records of their fathers-a genealogy
			and scripture. In this moment Nephi provides one of the most quoted
			and illuminating verses of scripture in his simple statement,
			"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will
			go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that
			the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he
			shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which
			he commandeth them." 1 Nephi 3:7

			This simple statement, when distilled to it''s essential elements,
			states,

			I WILL BEGIN.

			When they return, it falls upon Laman to convince Laban to give them the
			plates. But Laban is angered by Laman''s suggestion, throws him
			out, and tries to have him killed. The young men consult, and Laman
			and Lemuel are certain they''ve done everything that was expected
			of them. They went back, gave it their best try, and now, they
			presume, stand guiltless before their father. But again, the young
			Nephi, in Godly wisdom, says: "But behold I said unto them that:
			As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our
			father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which
			the Lord hath commanded us." 1 Nephi 3:15

			When we distill this simple statement to its essential elements, we hear,

			I WILL ENDURE

			A new plan to take all of their precious things to exchange for the
			plates of Laban fails miserably as well, and not only is the gold and
			silver taken from them, but they''re pursued by the armies of
			Laban who have been sent to kill them. Once again Laman and Lemuel
			confront Nephi, this time striking him with a rod, and once again
			Nephi persists, "And it came to pass that I spake unto my
			brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be
			faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is
			mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his
			fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?" 1 Nephi 4:1
			It''s not enough to have tried once, or to have risked everything
			and tried again. Nephi''s statement would seem insane to anyone
			who doesn''t understand the relationship of the Lord with his
			children. But Nephi''s eye is set, not on the waves of a
			turbulent sea, as Peter was one fateful evening, but on the love of
			his God. His simple statement above concisely affirms,

			WE (the Lord through me) WILL SUCCEED.

			To feel God''s love is to understand he cannot fail us-we can only
			fail him. To have God''s love is to look beyond earthly obstacles
			and acknowledge that so long as we''re involved in His work,
			we''ll have His strength, and His protection.

			Then, in this marvelous, faithful journey to follow the will of the Lord,
			submitting all desires to the Lord, and finally, submitting all
			fears, Nephi states, "And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing
			beforehand the things which I should do." 1 Nephi 4:6. In this
			simple testimony of faith the young believer simply states,

			Our Responsibility to seek God''s Love:

			One can only imagine the weight of responsibility that Moroni felt as he
			saw that the Nephite kingdom was about to be destroyed. He wrote
			words that he knew would lay hidden in the ground for centuries, and
			wrote them lovingly for a people he had only seen in prophetic
			vision. Yet knowing that the eternal impact of his words would be
			tremendous, he wrote to our generation in great anxiety of heart. One
			need only imagine oneself in Moroni''s position. What would be
			the words we would write to our posterity, having seen them, knowing
			their hearts, and having seen their desires? And how would we
			conclude our words, knowing that they would be the last not only to
			fall from our pen, but would be the final monument to the thousand
			year documentation of the spiritual lives of a great people? More
			immediately, what would we tell our children as they knelt beside our
			death bed? What would be the last words that fell from our mouths-the
			words that would matter most, and would ring in the ears of our
			children throughout their lives?

			Moroni concludes his work, and the work of a millennium of his ancestors,
			with the following admonitions: "Yea, come unto Christ, and be
			perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye
			shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your
			might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that
			by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God
			ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God. And
			again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not
			his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God,
			through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant
			of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy,
			without spot.
			And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of
			God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought
			forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar
			of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead.
			Amen." Moroni 10:32-34

			Moroni''s concluding words are what I refer to as "Holographic
			Verse". A hologram is a three dimensional picture of some
			object. Its special properties allow it to contain in every tiny
			picture element, information about the entire image. If a painting of
			a rose were torn into bits, we''d have many pieces that depicted
			various parts of a rose. One bit may show a fragment of stem, another
			a thorn, another some background, or a petal, or a vase, etc. Alone
			any element would be insufficient to show us that the original
			painting had been of a single rose. If a holographic rendering of a
			rose were dashed to pieces, however, we''d have innumerable
			fragments that all represent the entire rose, seen from a particular
			point of view. One fragment may be a representation as if we viewed
			the flower from above, another from one side, etc. Moroni''s
			final words contain a near complete blue-print for God''s plan
			for our happiness. Like a hologram, this complete picture of
			salvation is viewed from a particular vantage point-a Nephit prophet
			near the end of his life, writing to a people who wouldn''t be
			born for over 1,500 years, but a complete view. Distilled into
			it''s basic elements, the view of God''s plan for us is as
			follows:
			1- Be perfected in Christ, including overcoming sinfulness
			2- Love God
			3- Through obedience and God''s love (which may a synonym for the
			commonly used word "Grace"), we''re sanctified, or made
			holy, through the blood of Christ, or his atonement
			4- A reuniting will occur-a resurrection-- joining the body and spirit,
			and in this resurrected body we''ll join the ones we love.

			Note in the above formula the role that love plays. Throughout history
			man has tried to reach heaven through his works. The ancient
			Babylonians built a tower to reach God, their Hebrew brothers created
			intricate and confusing laws, and among every infidel people there
			seems to have arise some distortion of the law of sacrifice, as if
			this alone would justify us in our sins.

			At the other end of the Book of Mormon, almost 1,000 years earlier,
			another prophet explains the simple and pure formula by which Eternal
			Life is achieved: "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a
			steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a
			love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward,
			feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus
			saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.
			"And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none
			other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the
			kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and
			the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
			Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen." (2 Nephi
			31:20,21) The love of God and all men are the persistent requirements
			by which men may stand in the presence of their Eternal Father. And
			we may ask, how has this requirement been established? Surely God
			loves us. This is plain and manifest throughout the scriptures. But
			why has he placed such a premium on our returned love for him, and by
			extension, on our love of our fellow men?


			D&C121: 45, 46 Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and
			to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts
			unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of
			God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as
			the dews from heaven.
			46 The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an
			unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall
			be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall
			flow unto thee forever and ever.


			In his letter to the Galatians, Paul breaks the hologram of the plan of
			salvation into even smaller pieces, and holding up one tiny fragment
			distils all the law and the prophets into a single word: "For
			all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love
			thy neighbour as thyself." Galatians5:14 Now many consider that
			this law of love is a product of Christ''s mortal ministry, and
			is only found in the New Testament. Yet the law of love was clearly
			given to the Israelites on Mount Sinai. The very first of the 10
			commandments, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me", is
			a clear command to love God. In the Book of Deuteronomy (a word
			translated as "the repeated law", indicating that the
			people had heard it earlier) we read: "And thou shalt love the
			LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with
			all thy might." (Deuteronomy6:5).

			Like Moroni''s holographic fragment of the plan of Salvation, the
			Israelites are given the same plan: "And now, Israel, what doth
			the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to
			walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God
			with all thy heart and with all thy soul, To keep the commandments of
			the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy
			good?" Deut10:12,13 The formula:
			1- Fear God (a synonym for loving Him)
			2- Obey his commandments and serve Him

			After 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, and after the Lord had
			either destroyed or allowed to expire from old age the original host
			of Israel which had fled Egypt, but which couldn''t leave her
			behind, it was time to enter the promised land. Standing at the brink
			of their promised blessing, the younger, and now softer hearted host
			of Israel were once again instructed of the Lord as to those things
			that would be required of them to posses and retain this great
			blessing. Moses exhorts, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is
			one LORD: And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart,
			and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." Deut 6: 4,5

			To Joseph Knight Sr., the Lord clearly taught, "And no one can
			assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love,
			having faith, hope, and charity, being temperate in all things,
			whatsoever shall be entrusted to his care." D&C12:8

			Sacrifice

			The willful exchange of something we acknowledge has earthly value for
			something that we hope has eternal value.

			There is no righteous sacrifice that doesn''t lead us directly to the
			atonement of the Savior. From the firstlings of the flock to a
			grateful payment of tithing, all righteous sacrifice leads us to the
			great and final sacrifice-final not because man would never be asked
			to give again, but because it is the only sacrifice that will have
			power to break the bands of death.

			The Atonement of Jesus Christ

			D&C138:1 "On the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and
			eighteen, I sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;" So
			begins this writing of the Prophet Joseph F. Smith. And so I begin
			tonight, alone in a hotel room, pondering this most important
			subject-God''s Love. "And reflecting upon the great atoning
			sacrifice that was made by the Son of God, for the redemption of the
			world; 3 And the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father
			and the Son in the coming of the Redeemer into the world;
			4 That through his atonement, and by obedience to the principles of
			the gospel, mankind might be saved. (D&C138:2-4) And so in the
			beginning of the search I seem to stumble upon the end of the search,
			only to begin again. The answer to God''s love is in the
			atonement of Jesus Christ for each of us. This is the foundation for
			any understanding of God''s love-how he has manifested it for us,
			and how we find it in our own hearts to share with others.

			Moroni10:32 Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny
			yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all
			ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength,
			then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be
			perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in
			Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.
			33 And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny
			not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God,
			through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant
			of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy,
			without spot.
			34 And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise
			of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am
			brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the
			pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick
			and dead. Amen.

			To Latter-day Saints, it''s an Article of Faith: "We believe
			that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by
			obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel." Christ is
			the way. We are only saved through his atoning sacrifice.

			Love''s chief manifestation is seen in the grace of God as this is found in
			the infinite and eternal atonement. "For God so loved the world,
			that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
			should not perish, but have everlasting life." (John 3:16; D.
			& C. 34:3.) (Mormon Doctrine, Bruce R. McConkie, p. 459)

			In the winter of 1832, the young prophet Joseph and his companion
			Sidney Rigdon knelt in prayer and a vision of the eternities were
			open to them. In this great moment they experienced, not as if
			through hearing a recounting, but through their own experience, the
			kingdoms of glory, the plan of salvation, and the mission of the
			Savior upon the earth. In words far from equal to the light opened to
			their eyes they explain: "And this is the gospel, the glad
			tidings, which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us-That
			he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world,
			and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to
			cleanse it from all unrighteousness; That through him all might be
			saved whom the Father had put into his power and made by him;"
			D&C76:40-42 And in these simple words that we find it simple to
			explain to tiny children the whole and complexity of our existence is
			made clear. The good news or glad tidings, the point of our
			existence, the very gospel, is this: that we, God''s children,
			might be saved.

			D&C18:11,12 "For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the
			flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might
			repent and come unto him.
			12 And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men
			unto him, on conditions of repentance."

			D&C45:3-5 Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading
			your cause before him-
			4 Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no
			sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son
			which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might
			be glorified;
			5 Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name,
			that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.


			D&C38:4 I am the same which have taken the Zion of Enoch into mine own
			bosom; and verily, I say, even as many as have believed in my name,
			for I am Christ, and in mine own name, by the virtue of the blood
			which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the Father for them.

			Perhaps the most condemning words ever spoken of a man were those
			spoken by Joseph Smith of his friend, companion, and fellow disciple,
			Sidney Rigdon. The Prophet said, "Brother Sidney is a man whom I
			love, but he is not capable of that pure and steadfast love for those
			who are his benefactors that should characterize a President of the
			Church of Christ." (Joseph Fielding Smith, Church History and
			Modern Revelation, 4 vols. [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus
			Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1946-1949], 3: 7.)
			Sidney Rigdon''s faults echo of the man Paul describes to the
			Corinthians: "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of
			angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a
			tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and
			understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all
			faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
			nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and
			though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
			profiteth me nothing." (1Corinthians 13:1-3). Indeed, the early
			history of the Church was replete with those who would willingly
			sacrifice time, comfort, worldly things, even their own lives, but
			who did so without the pure and steadfast love-charity-which Joseph
			describes here.

			God''s love in sorrow:
			1 Peter 4:12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial
			which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:
			13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ''s
			sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad
			also with exceeding joy.

			1 Peter 4: 15 "But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a
			thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men''s
			matters.
			16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but
			let him glorify God on this behalf." In other words, herein
			Peter makes a distinction between that suffering which we incur
			because of our own evil-doing, and that suffering which comes from
			being one with Christ. To suffer for our own flesh is a consequence
			of our giving into temptation. To suffer because of the Love of God
			which is in us brings us unto God.

			Paul, seeing the suffering of the early saints, explains to the followers
			in Corinth, "For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation
			not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh
			death." 2 Corinthians 7:10

			And again, Mormon, sees the suffering of his own people, and at first
			sees great hope in their travail, but then see that their affliction
			has taken them down the wrong path.


			"And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their lamentation and their
			mourning and their sorrow before the Lord, my heart did begin to
			rejoice within me, knowing the mercies and the long-suffering of the
			Lord, therefore supposing that he would be merciful unto them that
			they would again become a righteous people.
			13 But behold this my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not unto
			repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was rather the
			sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer
			them to take happiness in sin. (Mormon 2:12,13)

			But what of we Latter-day Saints today who strive to do the Lord''s
			will? What of us who may not be guilty of committing any grevious
			sin, who''s hearts and hands are free from murderings and
			adultery, but who remain far from being perfect, as we have been
			commanded to become? Where does our suffering bring us?

			The same question could be asked of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who''s
			life, by his own admission, was imperfect, yet who reached out and
			grasped more godly knowledge and power than any other in this
			dispensation. Where did his many afflictions bring him? The answer
			seems clear-the sufferings of righteous men bring them to greater
			righteousness, to greater patience, greater humility, greater faith,
			and endurance, to more gratitude for every gift they receive, and to
			an expanded capacity for joy. Joseph Smith described himself: "I
			am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and
			the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by
			coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated
			force against religious bigotry, priestcraft, lawyer-craft,
			doctor-craft, lying editors, suborned judges and jurors, and the
			authority of perjured executives, backed by mobs, blasphemers,
			licentious and corrupt men and women-all hell knocking off a corner
			here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished
			shaft in the quiver of the Almighty, who will give me dominion over
			all and every one of them, when their refuge of lies shall fail, and
			their hiding place shall be destroyed, while these smooth-polished
			stones with which I come in contact become marred" (Teachings of
			the Prophet Joseph Smith, 304).

			Perhaps the Apostle Paul explained it most succinctly to the early saints in
			Rome: "And we know that all things work together for good to
			them that love God, to them who are the called according to his
			purpose." Romans 8:28



			"As bad as it can get, there is the assurance that there is purpose,
			that trials come to all God''s followers for their benefit, and
			that weeping endures only for a night for "joy cometh in the
			morning" (Ps. 30:5).
			The joy will often come not only because the trial is over but also
			because we know that with God''s help we have passed the test. If
			joy were dependent on the end of trials, we would often be
			disappointed, for the parade of problems continues; when one trial is
			done there is another around the proverbial corner." (Elaine
			Cannon, Adversity [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1987], 44.)







			Charity or Pure Love defined:
			The Apostle Paul defines Charity thusly: "Charity suffereth long,
			and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not
			puffed up,
			Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily
			provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth
			in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all
			things, endureth all things." (1 Corinthians 13:4-7)

			Moroni, perhaps quoting from the same ancient text as Paul, or inspired by
			the same spirit, gives much the same definition of Charity, and then
			defines it in its simplest terms: "And again, behold I say unto
			you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and
			lowly of heart. If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is
			acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart; and if a man
			be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy
			Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he
			have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.
			And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not
			puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no
			evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth,
			beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
			all things. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity,
			ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto
			charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail-But
			charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and
			whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with
			him." (Moroni7:43-47).

			Charity, purely and simply defined, is the pure love of Christ. The ancient
			prophets knew it. The Modern prophets have known it. Godly men and
			women have known and embraced this solemn truth.

			The Relationship of righteous sacrifice to love

			Service

			Love is always associated with and manifest through service. "Thou
			shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might,
			mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve
			him. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." (D. & C.
			59:5-6.) "If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my
			commandments." (D. & C. 42:29; John 14:15.) (Bruce R.
			McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, p. 459)
			In the book, "Love", President Ezra Taft Benson teaches,
			"The secret of a happy marriage is to serve God and each other.
			The goal of marriage is unity and oneness, as well as
			self-development. Paradoxically, the more we serve one another, the
			greater is our spiritual and emotional growth." (Love; various
			General Authorities; p. 3)

			Obedience
			Alma taught his son Shiblon, Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also
			see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with
			love; see that ye refrain from idleness. (Alma 38:12)

			Making Charity Happen
			In his April 2002 General Conference address, Elder Gene R. Cook makes
			the following recommendations to those who would see to find charity
			in their lives:
			1. Recognize His love. "Pray . . . with all the energy of
			heart" for this gift. Do so in meekness with a broken heart, and
			you will be filled with hope and love from the Holy Ghost Himself. He
			will reveal Christ to you.
			2. Receive His love in humility. Be grateful for the gift and
			especially for the giver of the gift. True gratitude is the ability
			to humbly see, feel, and even receive love. Gratitude is a form of
			returning love to God. Recognize His hand, tell Him so, express your
			love to Him. As you come to truly know the Lord, you will find an
			intimate, sacred relationship built on trust. You will come to know
			He understands your anguish and will, in compassion, always respond
			to you in love.
			3. Convey His love. The Lord''s response to us is always filled
			with love. Should not our response to Him be in kind, with real
			feelings of love? He gives grace (or goodness) for grace, attribute
			for attribute. As our obedience increases, we receive more grace (or
			goodness) for the grace we return to Him. Offer Him the refinement of
			your attributes, so that when He does appear you will be like Him.


			Repentance

			D&C18:11-13 "11 For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the
			flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might
			repent and come unto him.
			12 And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men
			unto him, on conditions of repentance.
			13 And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!


			"And of tenets thou shalt not talk, but thou shalt declare repentance and
			faith on the Savior, and remission of sins by baptism, and by fire,
			yea, even the Holy Ghost.
			Behold, this is a great and the last commandment which I shall give unto you
			concerning this matter; for this shall suffice for thy daily walk,
			even unto the end of thy life." D&C19:31,32

			Moroni 8:25, 26 And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism
			cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the
			fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins; 26 And the
			remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and
			because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of
			the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love,
			which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall
			come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.


			The Holy Ghost

			John14: 26,27 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
			will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all
			things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
			27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world
			giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let
			it be afraid.

			John15: 26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
			the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the
			Father, he shall testify of me;

			Moroni 8:25, 26 And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism
			cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the
			fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins; 26 And the
			remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and
			because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of
			the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love,
			which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall
			come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.

			Relationship with the Savior

			John 15:4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
			itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide
			in me. 5 I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me,
			and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye
			can do nothing.
			6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
			withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
			are burned.

			Meekness and Gratitude


			Keeping the Commandments
			John15:10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I
			have kept my Father''s commandments, and abide in his love.

			Psalms 19: The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
			testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
			8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
			commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
			9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of
			the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
			10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
			sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
			11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there
			is great reward.

			The members of the Church who keep the commandments have this promise:
			"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall
			tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
			peril, or sword? . . . Nay, in all these things we are more than
			conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded" - Paul
			is speaking - "that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
			principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
			nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
			separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
			Lord" (Rom. 8:35-39.) (Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, p.
			460)

			Synonyms for God''s Love

			Joy
			JST John 15:11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might
			remain in you, and that your joy might be full.

			2Nephi2:25 Adam fell…

			Grace
			"Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of
			all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness,
			and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his
			grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in
			Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can
			in nowise deny the power of God." And again, if ye by the grace
			of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye
			sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the
			blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the
			remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot."
			Moroni10:32,33 32

			Fear
			The word "fear" seems to denote different things in different
			parts of the scriptures. Where it refers to man''s relationship
			with Diety, however, the word often suggests deep love and respect as
			opposed to terror or distrust. The basis of the word
			"fear", in any context, is subjugation or acknowledgement
			of inferiority. A person''s fear of high places, for example, is
			an acknowledgement that the consequences of a misstep from such a
			place will be beyond ones'' control. Such can be said of other
			fears or phobias-they derive from an acknowledgement of inferiority
			to a superior force, imagined or real.

			Man therefore fears God when man is humble enough to admit to himself
			that there''s a greater power in the Universe than himself. As
			inevitable as the consequences of natural laws such as gravity or
			darkness, God''s laws have consequences. The basis of our
			"fear" of God is humility. Unlike other natural laws,
			however, our understanding of heavenly laws grows from an
			understanding that they''re based on a plan to make us happy. The
			sinner may be brought to fear God as he feels remorse for his sins,
			and realizes that eternal misery awaits him as a consequence. But
			this fear, or distrust of God (as if he were an assailant) quickly
			grows within the humbled sinner''s heart as it changes to a fear,
			or love for God who has prepared a plan of repentance and forgiveness
			of sin.

			Consider King Benjamin''s great sermon to his people:

			Mosiah 5:1 "And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made
			an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the
			angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the
			multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of
			the Lord had come upon them." In this verse one could easily
			infer that the people, reminded of their own sinful ways, had fallen
			to the earth because, having seen their own filthiness, they
			literally doubted, and therefore feared, that they would be able to
			gain a celestial reward. Their fall to the ground would in this
			context have been as the victim before the assailant, trembling and
			begging for mercy.

			This thought continues in the next verse: 2 "And they had viewed
			themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the
			earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have
			mercy…" Here we might imagine our helpless, groveling victim.
			But then our perspective changes as the people explain that they have
			great hope, even knowledge, that something better awaits them:
			".and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive
			forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we
			believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and
			earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of
			men." The people, having understood God''s love for them,
			fell to the ground in full faith that they would receive a remission
			of their sins through the atoning blood of Christ.

			This being said, there''s value in rereading the first verse of
			Mosiah 5, now substituting the word "fear" with the idea of
			its intended synonym, "God''s love". We read, "And
			now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of
			speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the angel of
			the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and
			behold they had fallen to the earth, for the [love] of the Lord had
			come upon them." Perhaps the salient question is this: Do the
			Lord''s children respond more meaningfully and powerfully through
			the repellent force of a distrustful fear of their Father, or from a
			humble and respectful love of the same?

			We can substitute this word "love" for "fear" in
			many other verses of scripture. To the children of Israel, wandering
			dependently in the wilderness for 40 years, Moses asks, "And
			now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear
			the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to
			serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, To
			keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command
			thee this day for thy good?" Deut10:12,13 We note in this verse
			the juxtaposition of the commandments to both fear and love the Lord.

			Gratitude
			In his April 2002 Conference Address, Elder Gene R. Cook admonishes us:
			"Receive His [the Lord''s] love in humility. Be grateful for
			the gift and especially for the giver of the gift. True gratitude is
			the ability to humbly see, feel, and even receive love. Gratitude is
			a form of returning love to God. Recognize His hand, tell Him so,
			express your love to Him. As you come to truly know the Lord, you
			will find an intimate, sacred relationship built on trust. You will
			come to know He understands your anguish and will, in compassion,
			always respond to you in love."


			Charity
			Of all synonyms for God''s love, the most comprehensive seems to be
			the word "charity". Bruce R. McConkie explains, "Above
			all the attributes of godliness and perfection, charity is the one
			most devoutly to be desired. Charity is more than love, far more; it
			is everlasting love, perfect love, the pure love of Christ which
			endureth forever. It is love so centered in righteousness that the
			possessor has no aim or desire except for the eternal welfare of his
			own soul and for the souls of those around him. (Mormon Doctrine, p.
			121).

			Moroni 7:46 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are
			nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity,
			which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail-
			47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and
			whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with
			him.
			48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the
			energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath
			bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ;
			that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we
			shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have
			this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.

			2 Nephi 26:30 Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore,
			the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have
			charity, which charity is love. And except they should have charity
			they were nothing. Wherefore, if they should have charity they would
			not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.

			The Spirit of the Lord
			See 1 Nephi 1:12

			The Spirit of Christ
			For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know
			good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for
			every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in
			Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye
			may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God. Moroni 7:16

			The Power and Gift of Christ

			Nephi 2:4)

			Fountain of Living Waters
			And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father
			had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living
			waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of
			the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a
			representation of the love of God. (1 Nephi 11:25)

			Tree of Life
			And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father

			Blessed (See the Beatitudes-Matt 5:3-13)

			The Power of God
			I am filled with the power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh
			(1 Nephi 17:48) v. He hath filled me with his love, even unto the
			consuming of my flesh. (2 Nephi 4:21)

			Opposition in all things

			2Nephi2:15 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he
			had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the
			fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must
			needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in
			opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other
			bitter.

			2Nephi 2: 22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not
			have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And
			all things which were created must have remained in the same state in
			which they were after they were created; and they must have remained
			forever, and had no end.
			23 And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have
			remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no
			misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.
			Agency
			2Nephi 2: 15 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man,
			after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field
			and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created,
			it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden
			fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the
			other bitter.
			16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for
			himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be
			that he was enticed by the one or the other.

			Blessings promised to those who love God:
			After wandering 40 years in the Wilderness, Moses brought his people up to
			the edge of their promised land, and gave them instruction. The book
			of Deuteronomy, from which we read an account of these events, is a
			repetition of the Law of God. Moses reminds the people: "For the
			land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of
			Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and
			wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: But the land,
			whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and
			drinketh water of the rain of heaven: A land which the LORD thy God
			careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the
			beginning of the year even unto the end of the year. And it shall
			come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments
			which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve
			him with all your heart and with all your soul,
			That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first
			rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and
			thy wine, and thine oil." Deut11:10-15. In Egypt, the fertile
			soil and flowing river around Goshen made it relatively simple to
			care for oneself. One could simply scatter seeds on the ground, push
			them into the soil, and they would sprout. But this new generation of
			Israelities were to be humble, and were to look to the Lord for their
			support. The rain would fall because they were obedient to him. The
			daily manna of their fathers was to become the seasonal manna of rain
			and sunshine one which they would depend for their very existence.
			The faucet, as it were, to irrigate their land and make it fertile,
			was their love of God.

			Many times the Lord removes those, whom he loves, from an Egypt, where
			they''re captive to their own desires and to the strength of
			their own flesh, and he moves them to a condition wherein they must
			look to Him for their support.

			Love is knowledge, wisdom, and power

			D&C 121:45, 46 Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men,
			and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts
			unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of
			God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as
			the dews from heaven.
			46 The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an
			unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall
			be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall
			flow unto thee forever and ever.

			Miscelaneous

			As I was pondering love today, the following quote caught my attention:
			Love established in the home then extends out to the neighborhood,
			the state, the nation, and the world and has the power to bind people
			together and make them one. "Differences of language, of
			education, of race and of nationality all disappear. Under its
			influence, prejudices and animosities vanish" (Cannon, George Q.
			Gospel Truth p. 299). This comes out of the encyclopedia of Mormonism
			under "love". The reference to language is what struck me,
			and that differences of language will disappear with love. Applying
			this to the Tower of Babel I can''t help but wonder if what
			caused the collapse of the unified language was indeed the
			dissolution of love between the people. I also can''t help but
			wonder if the Adamic language is founded, not on linguistics, but on
			love. Is this where the gift of tongues derives-this Godly love? How
			else can it be explained?

			A Book of Mormon Tour of Godly Love

			This tour explores the Book of Mormon as a historical field guide, of
			sorts, into the understanding of Godly Love. Through every chapter, I
			suppose, there are references, either overtly or implied, that
			demonstrate Godly Love, or the consequences of those who choose to
			turn away from the Lord.


			1 Nephi 1:1 "I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents,
			therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and
			having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless,
			having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having
			had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God,
			therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days."

			Nephi begins his first narrative in the Book of Mormon, which becomes the
			first chapter and verse, by describing the love of parents to
			children, the importance of educating them, the reality of
			afflictions in all of our lives, and the blessings which come as we
			overcome our afflictions, having faith in God, and learning of His
			ways. It begins with open gratitude to his acknowledged Heavenly
			Father for great gifts. It begins with a Godly man, standing within
			himself, yet looking beyond himself:
			· Acknowledgement of Parents
			· Importance of education
			· Overcoming adversity
			· Gratitude to the Lord
			· Learning of the Lord
			· Importance of record keeping

			In fact, the first verse of the Book of Mormon becomes, as it were, a
			type and a shadow for the rest of the book. It also becomes a
			synopsis of what it means to experience Godly Love. This love of a
			Heavenly Father begins in the love of earthly parents who teach and
			nourish us, and moves on to how we use our earthly blessings to bless
			others.

			Within a few verses we come to understand the context of the people who
			would be known as the Nephites-a people born in a tumultuous time in
			the history of Israel-a people who would either leave to escape the
			onslaught of the Babylonians, or who would be conquered and carried
			away by them. And here we find the man Lehi, blessed by the Lord and
			prospering in earthly ways, yet focused outside of himself.

			1 Nephi 1:5. "Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as
			he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in
			behalf of his people." We''ve journeyed only 5 verses into
			the Book of Mormon and we''ve learned the order of love-God to
			his children, children to fathers, and now, man to his brother-the
			human family. It''s not enough to speak of God''s love for
			us, but rather, we must speak of God''s love in us, or through
			us-we being the mirror that immediately reflects God''s light
			onto our brethren.

			In his vision, Lehi is handed a book of scripture to read, and as he
			reads, he''s "filled with the Spirit of the Lord." (1
			Nephi 1:12). We now come upon another synonym for "God''s
			Love", which is "the Spirit of the Lord". If we
			literally accept the Biblical Pronouncement by the Apostle John that
			"God is love" (1 John 4:8), we can use the terms God and
			Love interchangeably. To say that Lehi is filled with the Spirit of
			the Lord is equal to saying he is filled with the Spirit of Love. In
			this way each person who feels the Spirit of the Lord recognizes this
			love in is/her life. John elaborates: "Beloved, let us love one
			another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of
			God, and knoweth God." (1 John 4:7) Being filled with this
			Spirit, or in other words, this Love, it''s no surprise to learn
			what Lehi does next. His heart is turned inside out, as he looks from
			self to his fellow men, and jeapordizes his life to go out and preach
			among them. His heart is filled with gratitude as he turns to the
			lord and exclaims, "Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord
			God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and
			goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and,
			because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto
			thee that they shall perish!" (1 Nephi 1:14) This godly mercy of
			which Lehi speaks is another synonym for the idea of God''s love.
			Nephi explains, "But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that
			the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath
			chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the
			power of deliverance." (1 Nephi 1:20)

			As Lehi continues to be faithful in the charge he''s received to
			warn his fellow men, we read the following: "For behold, it came
			to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and
			said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which
			thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto
			this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to
			take away thy life." 1 Nephi 2:1 This great man has put away
			personal considerations and fears (pride) to do the will of the Lord,
			and for this he''s "blessed". We may well ask, what
			does it mean to be "blessed"? Webster''s 1828
			Dictionary defines the term, in part, as "enjoying spiritual
			happiness and the favor of God; enjoying heavenly felicity".
			This definition is quite insightful. Note that the term doesn''t
			express as much what God has given his children, but rather, their
			recognition and acknowledgement of those gifts. In other words, we
			might well ask, "to whom has the Lord denied gifts that would
			bring them back to him?" What child of God is their upon this
			earth whom the Lord has denied those spiritual and temporal gifts
			that would allow him/her to return to their Heavenly Father? The
			answer, quite simply, is none. Every soul born upon this earth was
			already one of the elect-a victor in the War in Heaven. Every soul is
			born with the same destiny to return and live in a Heavenly Home,
			"For there is no respect of persons with God." Romans 2:11
			The blessed man or woman, therefore, isn''t that soul who has
			received the greatest amount from God, but rather, is that person who
			recognizes God''s gifts in his/her life. The blessed soul
			isn''t he who has received most, for we all receive according to
			our capacity to receive. The blessed soul is that which recognizes
			God''s love and His gifts.

			Consider the Beatitudes in this context (Matthew 5:3-13):
			· Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
			· Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
			· Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
			· Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for
			they shall be filled.
			· Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
			· Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
			· Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children
			of God.
			· Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness'' sake:
			for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
			· Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
			shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
			Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven:
			for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
			In each case, a person is recognized as blessed, not for something the
			Lord has given them, but for something they''ve given back to the
			Lord. In each case the person is blessed who has submitted to the
			will of the Father (is poor in spirit, mourns, is meek, hungers after
			righteousness, is merciful, pure in heart, a peacemaker, is
			persecuted for righteousness'' sake, suffers for the Lord).
			He''s blessed first for what he has submitted himself to, and
			he''s promised blessings afterwards for the consequence of his
			choice (obtains the kingdom of heaven, is comforted, inherits the
			earth, is filled, obtains mercy, sees God, is called a Child of God,
			obtains the kingdom of heaven, receives a great reward in Heaven.)
			Thus, when the Lord pronounces Lehi blessed for his selfless actions,
			we might wonder about this-he must abandon riches, and any reputation
			among men he may have had. He must leave the comfort of a luxurious
			home, and take an often-rebellious family into the wilderness to be
			deprived of a lifestyle many would argue he''d earned. But
			he''s blessed for who he is, having submitted to God''s will,
			feeling God''s love in his life. Lehi is "blessed"
			during the sacrifices he makes, because through these righteous acts
			of submission to God''s will, he feels God''s love.
			Conversely, we might add that any act of self-deprivation that
			doesn''t allow us to feel God''s love at the moment of
			submission probably isn''t a "blessing" to us.
			We''re only blessed in sacrifice as it draws us closer to God and
			allows us to feel his love for and through us.

			So Lehi draws his family together, and in willing submission to
			God''s will, leaves the comfortable life he knew, and departs
			into the wilderness. We know that some of his family has gone through
			the process to believe, and walks with him in faith. Nephi prays, and
			receives a steady answer that his father has indeed been instructed
			of the Lord. Lehi receives the vision, and Nephi confirms it through
			prayer. Then Nephi bears testimony to his brother Sam, who, through
			Nephi''s faith and testimony, gains testimony of the same. But
			Laman and Lemuel are unwilling to submit themselves-unwilling to
			believe. "And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did
			murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they knew
			not the dealings of that God who had created them." (1Nephi2:12)
			They "knew not the dealings…of God." In other words, they
			were unfamiliar with his ways, with his intercession with his
			children, and with his love for them. What faith could they possibly
			have in a being whom they hadn''t come to know. What courage
			would they be able to draw as they left all of their comforts, that
			they''d continue to be happy and watched over? For Nephi, the
			journey into the wilderness was relatively simple. His journey was
			governed by a single great principle, for he did know the dealings of
			God. He knew that at all times, and in every moment, through every
			hardship and trial, he was loved by the only being in the Universe
			who''s feelings really matter.
			We learn from the writings of the prophet Joseph Smith, that
			"Faith, then, is the first great governing principle which has
			power, dominion, and authority over all things; by it they exist, by
			it they are upheld, by it they are changed, or by it they remain,
			agreeable to the will of God." (Lectures on Faith, 1:24.) What
			is faith, then, if not the understanding that God loves us, and seeks
			the best for us? To exercise faith, then, is simply a matter of
			trust, that the Lord will seek out the best for us, and is, in all
			ways, empowered to deliver it to us. Nephi and Lehi had this faith
			through vision, Sam and Sariah had it through their willingness to be
			counseled by Lehi and Nephi. But Laman and Lemuel rejected the
			Lord''s overtures of love, and thus knew now his workings.

			For Nephi, it wasn''t sufficient to gain a testimony of the Gospel
			of Jesus Christ. He wanted to learn more. He wanted to understand the
			"mysteries of God", which I suppose, simply means those
			things that are revealed to an individual through study and prayer.
			He records, "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being
			exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also
			having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I
			did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my
			heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my
			father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my
			brothers." 1 Nephi 2:16 Why did Nephi need to soften his heart,
			and what exactly does the phrase mean? We know that the term has
			something to do with humility, and something to do with being
			teachable.

			The commandment Lehi received to leave all their worldly wealth and go
			to some unseen promised land would have been difficult to obey. But
			for his sons, the commandment to return to their former home, collect
			all of their abandoned wealth, then take it to a man they greatly
			feared in exchange for something which had little earthly value-this
			was a true test. Lehi sent his sons, Laman, Lemuel, Sam and Nephi
			back to Jerusalem to fetch the records of their fathers-a genealogy
			and scripture. In this moment Nephi provides one of the most quoted
			and illuminating verses of scripture in his simple statement,
			"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will
			go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that
			the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he
			shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which
			he commandeth them." 1 Nephi 3:7

			This simple statement, when distilled to it''s essential elements,
			states,

			I WILL BEGIN.

			When they return, it falls upon Laman to convince Laban to give them the
			plates. But Laban is angered by Laman''s suggestion, throws him
			out, and tries to have him killed. The young men consult, and Laman
			and Lemuel are certain they''ve done everything that was expected
			of them. They went back, gave it their best try, and now, they
			presume, stand guiltless before their father. But again, the young
			Nephi, in Godly wisdom, says: "But behold I said unto them that:
			As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our
			father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which
			the Lord hath commanded us." 1 Nephi 3:15

			When we distill this simple statement to its essential elements, we hear,

			I WILL ENDURE

			A new plan to take all of their precious things to exchange for the
			plates of Laban fails miserably as well, and not only is the gold and
			silver taken from them, but they''re pursued by the armies of
			Laban who have been sent to kill them. Once again Laman and Lemuel
			confront Nephi, this time striking him with a rod, and once again
			Nephi persists, "And it came to pass that I spake unto my
			brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be
			faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is
			mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his
			fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?" 1 Nephi 4:1
			It''s not enough to have tried once, or to have risked everything
			and tried again. Nephi''s statement would seem insane to anyone
			who doesn''t understand the relationship of the Lord with his
			children. But Nephi''s eye is set, not on the waves of a
			turbulent sea, as Peter was one fateful evening, but on the love of
			his God. His simple statement above concisely affirms,

			WE (the Lord through me) WILL SUCCEED.

			To feel God''s love is to understand he cannot fail us-we can only
			fail him. To have God''s love is to look beyond earthly obstacles
			and acknowledge that so long as we''re involved in His work,
			we''ll have His strength, and His protection.

			Then, in this marvelous, faithful journey to follow the will of the Lord,
			submitting all desires to the Lord, and finally, submitting all
			fears, Nephi states, "And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing
			beforehand the things which I should do." 1 Nephi 4:6. In this
			simple testimony of faith the young believer simply states,

			In Search of God''s Love



			Our Responsibility to seek God''s Love:

			One can only imagine the weight of responsibility that Moroni felt as he
			saw that the Nephite kingdom was about to be destroyed. He wrote
			words that he knew would lay hidden in the ground for centuries, and
			wrote them lovingly for a people he had only seen in prophetic
			vision. Yet knowing that the eternal impact of his words would be
			tremendous, he wrote to our generation in great anxiety of heart. One
			need only imagine oneself in Moroni''s position. What would be
			the words we would write to our posterity, having seen them, knowing
			their hearts, and having seen their desires? And how would we
			conclude our words, knowing that they would be the last not only to
			fall from our pen, but would be the final monument to the thousand
			year documentation of the spiritual lives of a great people? More
			immediately, what would we tell our children as they knelt beside our
			death bed? What would be the last words that fell from our mouths-the
			words that would matter most, and would ring in the ears of our
			children throughout their lives?

			Moroni concludes his work, and the work of a millennium of his ancestors,
			with the following admonitions: "Yea, come unto Christ, and be
			perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye
			shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your
			might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that
			by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God
			ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God. And
			again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not
			his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God,
			through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant
			of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy,
			without spot.
			And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of
			God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought
			forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar
			of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead.
			Amen." Moroni 10:32-34

			Moroni''s concluding words are what I refer to as "Holographic
			Verse". A hologram is a three dimensional picture of some
			object. Its special properties allow it to contain in every tiny
			picture element, information about the entire image. If a painting of
			a rose were torn into bits, we''d have many pieces that depicted
			various parts of a rose. One bit may show a fragment of stem, another
			a thorn, another some background, or a petal, or a vase, etc. Alone
			any element would be insufficient to show us that the original
			painting had been of a single rose. If a holographic rendering of a
			rose were dashed to pieces, however, we''d have innumerable
			fragments that all represent the entire rose, seen from a particular
			point of view. One fragment may be a representation as if we viewed
			the flower from above, another from one side, etc. Moroni''s
			final words contain a near complete blue-print for God''s plan
			for our happiness. Like a hologram, this complete picture of
			salvation is viewed from a particular vantage point-a Nephit prophet
			near the end of his life, writing to a people who wouldn''t be
			born for over 1,500 years, but a complete view. Distilled into
			it''s basic elements, the view of God''s plan for us is as
			follows:
			1- Be perfected in Christ, including overcoming sinfulness
			2- Love God
			3- Through obedience and God''s love (which may a synonym for the
			commonly used word "Grace"), we''re sanctified, or made
			holy, through the blood of Christ, or his atonement
			4- A reuniting will occur-a resurrection-- joining the body and spirit,
			and in this resurrected body we''ll join the ones we love.

			Note in the above formula the role that love plays. Throughout history
			man has tried to reach heaven through his works. The ancient
			Babylonians built a tower to reach God, their Hebrew brothers created
			intricate and confusing laws, and among every infidel people there
			seems to have arise some distortion of the law of sacrifice, as if
			this alone would justify us in our sins.

			At the other end of the Book of Mormon, almost 1,000 years earlier,
			another prophet explains the simple and pure formula by which Eternal
			Life is achieved: "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a
			steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a
			love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward,
			feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus
			saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.
			"And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none
			other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the
			kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and
			the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
			Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen." (2 Nephi
			31:20,21) The love of God and all men are the persistent requirements
			by which men may stand in the presence of their Eternal Father. And
			we may ask, how has this requirement been established? Surely God
			loves us. This is plain and manifest throughout the scriptures. But
			why has he placed such a premium on our returned love for him, and by
			extension, on our love of our fellow men?


			D&C121: 45, 46 Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and
			to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts
			unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of
			God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as
			the dews from heaven.
			46 The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an
			unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall
			be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall
			flow unto thee forever and ever.


			In his letter to the Galatians, Paul breaks the hologram of the plan of
			salvation into even smaller pieces, and holding up one tiny fragment
			distils all the law and the prophets into a single word: "For
			all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love
			thy neighbour as thyself." Galatians5:14 Now many consider that
			this law of love is a product of Christ''s mortal ministry, and
			is only found in the New Testament. Yet the law of love was clearly
			given to the Israelites on Mount Sinai. The very first of the 10
			commandments, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me", is
			a clear command to love God. In the Book of Deuteronomy (a word
			translated as "the repeated law", indicating that the
			people had heard it earlier) we read: "And thou shalt love the
			LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with
			all thy might." (Deuteronomy6:5).

			Like Moroni''s holographic fragment of the plan of Salvation, the
			Israelites are given the same plan: "And now, Israel, what doth
			the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to
			walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God
			with all thy heart and with all thy soul, To keep the commandments of
			the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy
			good?" Deut10:12,13 The formula:
			1- Fear God (a synonym for loving Him)
			2- Obey his commandments and serve Him

			After 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, and after the Lord had
			either destroyed or allowed to expire from old age the original host
			of Israel which had fled Egypt, but which couldn''t leave her
			behind, it was time to enter the promised land. Standing at the brink
			of their promised blessing, the younger, and now softer hearted host
			of Israel were once again instructed of the Lord as to those things
			that would be required of them to posses and retain this great
			blessing. Moses exhorts, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is
			one LORD: And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart,
			and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." Deut 6: 4,5

			To Joseph Knight Sr., the Lord clearly taught, "And no one can
			assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love,
			having faith, hope, and charity, being temperate in all things,
			whatsoever shall be entrusted to his care." D&C12:8

			Sacrifice

			The willful exchange of something we acknowledge has earthly value for
			something that we hope has eternal value.

			There is no righteous sacrifice that doesn''t lead us directly to the
			atonement of the Savior. From the firstlings of the flock to a
			grateful payment of tithing, all righteous sacrifice leads us to the
			great and final sacrifice-final not because man would never be asked
			to give again, but because it is the only sacrifice that will have
			power to break the bands of death.

			The Atonement of Jesus Christ

			D&C138:1 "On the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and
			eighteen, I sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;" So
			begins this writing of the Prophet Joseph F. Smith. And so I begin
			tonight, alone in a hotel room, pondering this most important
			subject-God''s Love. "And reflecting upon the great atoning
			sacrifice that was made by the Son of God, for the redemption of the
			world; 3 And the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father
			and the Son in the coming of the Redeemer into the world;
			4 That through his atonement, and by obedience to the principles of
			the gospel, mankind might be saved. (D&C138:2-4) And so in the
			beginning of the search I seem to stumble upon the end of the search,
			only to begin again. The answer to God''s love is in the
			atonement of Jesus Christ for each of us. This is the foundation for
			any understanding of God''s love-how he has manifested it for us,
			and how we find it in our own hearts to share with others.

			Moroni10:32 Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny
			yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all
			ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength,
			then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be
			perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in
			Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.
			33 And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny
			not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God,
			through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant
			of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy,
			without spot.
			34 And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise
			of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am
			brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the
			pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick
			and dead. Amen.

			To Latter-day Saints, it''s an Article of Faith: "We believe
			that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by
			obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel." Christ is
			the way. We are only saved through his atoning sacrifice.

			Love''s chief manifestation is seen in the grace of God as this is found in
			the infinite and eternal atonement. "For God so loved the world,
			that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
			should not perish, but have everlasting life." (John 3:16; D.
			& C. 34:3.) (Mormon Doctrine, Bruce R. McConkie, p. 459)

			In the winter of 1832, the young prophet Joseph and his companion
			Sidney Rigdon knelt in prayer and a vision of the eternities were
			open to them. In this great moment they experienced, not as if
			through hearing a recounting, but through their own experience, the
			kingdoms of glory, the plan of salvation, and the mission of the
			Savior upon the earth. In words far from equal to the light opened to
			their eyes they explain: "And this is the gospel, the glad
			tidings, which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us-That
			he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world,
			and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to
			cleanse it from all unrighteousness; That through him all might be
			saved whom the Father had put into his power and made by him;"
			D&C76:40-42 And in these simple words that we find it simple to
			explain to tiny children the whole and complexity of our existence is
			made clear. The good news or glad tidings, the point of our
			existence, the very gospel, is this: that we, God''s children,
			might be saved.

			D&C18:11,12 "For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the
			flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might
			repent and come unto him.
			12 And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men
			unto him, on conditions of repentance."

			D&C45:3-5 Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading
			your cause before him-
			4 Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no
			sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son
			which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might
			be glorified;
			5 Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name,
			that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.


			D&C38:4 I am the same which have taken the Zion of Enoch into mine own
			bosom; and verily, I say, even as many as have believed in my name,
			for I am Christ, and in mine own name, by the virtue of the blood
			which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the Father for them.

			Perhaps the most condemning words ever spoken of a man were those
			spoken by Joseph Smith of his friend, companion, and fellow disciple,
			Sidney Rigdon. The Prophet said, "Brother Sidney is a man whom I
			love, but he is not capable of that pure and steadfast love for those
			who are his benefactors that should characterize a President of the
			Church of Christ." (Joseph Fielding Smith, Church History and
			Modern Revelation, 4 vols. [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus
			Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1946-1949], 3: 7.)
			Sidney Rigdon''s faults echo of the man Paul describes to the
			Corinthians: "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of
			angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a
			tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and
			understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all
			faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
			nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and
			though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
			profiteth me nothing." (1Corinthians 13:1-3). Indeed, the early
			history of the Church was replete with those who would willingly
			sacrifice time, comfort, worldly things, even their own lives, but
			who did so without the pure and steadfast love-charity-which Joseph
			describes here.

			God''s love in sorrow:
			1 Peter 4:12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial
			which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:
			13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ''s
			sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad
			also with exceeding joy.

			1 Peter 4: 15 "But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a
			thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men''s
			matters.
			16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but
			let him glorify God on this behalf." In other words, herein
			Peter makes a distinction between that suffering which we incur
			because of our own evil-doing, and that suffering which comes from
			being one with Christ. To suffer for our own flesh is a consequence
			of our giving into temptation. To suffer because of the Love of God
			which is in us brings us unto God.

			Paul, seeing the suffering of the early saints, explains to the followers
			in Corinth, "For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation
			not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh
			death." 2 Corinthians 7:10

			And again, Mormon, sees the suffering of his own people, and at first
			sees great hope in their travail, but then see that their affliction
			has taken them down the wrong path.


			"And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their lamentation and their
			mourning and their sorrow before the Lord, my heart did begin to
			rejoice within me, knowing the mercies and the long-suffering of the
			Lord, therefore supposing that he would be merciful unto them that
			they would again become a righteous people.
			13 But behold this my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not unto
			repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was rather the
			sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer
			them to take happiness in sin. (Mormon 2:12,13)

			But what of we Latter-day Saints today who strive to do the Lord''s
			will? What of us who may not be guilty of committing any grevious
			sin, who''s hearts and hands are free from murderings and
			adultery, but who remain far from being perfect, as we have been
			commanded to become? Where does our suffering bring us?

			The same question could be asked of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who''s
			life, by his own admission, was imperfect, yet who reached out and
			grasped more godly knowledge and power than any other in this
			dispensation. Where did his many afflictions bring him? The answer
			seems clear-the sufferings of righteous men bring them to greater
			righteousness, to greater patience, greater humility, greater faith,
			and endurance, to more gratitude for every gift they receive, and to
			an expanded capacity for joy. Joseph Smith described himself: "I
			am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and
			the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by
			coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated
			force against religious bigotry, priestcraft, lawyer-craft,
			doctor-craft, lying editors, suborned judges and jurors, and the
			authority of perjured executives, backed by mobs, blasphemers,
			licentious and corrupt men and women-all hell knocking off a corner
			here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished
			shaft in the quiver of the Almighty, who will give me dominion over
			all and every one of them, when their refuge of lies shall fail, and
			their hiding place shall be destroyed, while these smooth-polished
			stones with which I come in contact become marred" (Teachings of
			the Prophet Joseph Smith, 304).

			Perhaps the Apostle Paul explained it most succinctly to the early saints in
			Rome: "And we know that all things work together for good to
			them that love God, to them who are the called according to his
			purpose." Romans 8:28



			"As bad as it can get, there is the assurance that there is purpose,
			that trials come to all God''s followers for their benefit, and
			that weeping endures only for a night for "joy cometh in the
			morning" (Ps. 30:5).
			The joy will often come not only because the trial is over but also
			because we know that with God''s help we have passed the test. If
			joy were dependent on the end of trials, we would often be
			disappointed, for the parade of problems continues; when one trial is
			done there is another around the proverbial corner." (Elaine
			Cannon, Adversity [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1987], 44.)







			Charity or Pure Love defined:
			The Apostle Paul defines Charity thusly: "Charity suffereth long,
			and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not
			puffed up,
			Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily
			provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth
			in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all
			things, endureth all things." (1 Corinthians 13:4-7)

			Moroni, perhaps quoting from the same ancient text as Paul, or inspired by
			the same spirit, gives much the same definition of Charity, and then
			defines it in its simplest terms: "And again, behold I say unto
			you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and
			lowly of heart. If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is
			acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart; and if a man
			be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy
			Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he
			have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.
			And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not
			puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no
			evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth,
			beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
			all things. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity,
			ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto
			charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail-But
			charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and
			whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with
			him." (Moroni7:43-47).

			Charity, purely and simply defined, is the pure love of Christ. The ancient
			prophets knew it. The Modern prophets have known it. Godly men and
			women have known and embraced this solemn truth.

			The Relationship of righteous sacrifice to love

			Service

			Love is always associated with and manifest through service. "Thou
			shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might,
			mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve
			him. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." (D. & C.
			59:5-6.) "If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my
			commandments." (D. & C. 42:29; John 14:15.) (Bruce R.
			McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, p. 459)
			In the book, "Love", President Ezra Taft Benson teaches,
			"The secret of a happy marriage is to serve God and each other.
			The goal of marriage is unity and oneness, as well as
			self-development. Paradoxically, the more we serve one another, the
			greater is our spiritual and emotional growth." (Love; various
			General Authorities; p. 3)

			Obedience
			Alma taught his son Shiblon, Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also
			see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with
			love; see that ye refrain from idleness. (Alma 38:12)

			Making Charity Happen
			In his April 2002 General Conference address, Elder Gene R. Cook makes
			the following recommendations to those who would see to find charity
			in their lives:
			1. Recognize His love. "Pray . . . with all the energy of
			heart" for this gift. Do so in meekness with a broken heart, and
			you will be filled with hope and love from the Holy Ghost Himself. He
			will reveal Christ to you.
			2. Receive His love in humility. Be grateful for the gift and
			especially for the giver of the gift. True gratitude is the ability
			to humbly see, feel, and even receive love. Gratitude is a form of
			returning love to God. Recognize His hand, tell Him so, express your
			love to Him. As you come to truly know the Lord, you will find an
			intimate, sacred relationship built on trust. You will come to know
			He understands your anguish and will, in compassion, always respond
			to you in love.
			3. Convey His love. The Lord''s response to us is always filled
			with love. Should not our response to Him be in kind, with real
			feelings of love? He gives grace (or goodness) for grace, attribute
			for attribute. As our obedience increases, we receive more grace (or
			goodness) for the grace we return to Him. Offer Him the refinement of
			your attributes, so that when He does appear you will be like Him.


			Repentance

			D&C18:11-13 "11 For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the
			flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might
			repent and come unto him.
			12 And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men
			unto him, on conditions of repentance.
			13 And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!


			"And of tenets thou shalt not talk, but thou shalt declare repentance and
			faith on the Savior, and remission of sins by baptism, and by fire,
			yea, even the Holy Ghost.
			Behold, this is a great and the last commandment which I shall give unto you
			concerning this matter; for this shall suffice for thy daily walk,
			even unto the end of thy life." D&C19:31,32

			Moroni 8:25, 26 And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism
			cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the
			fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins; 26 And the
			remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and
			because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of
			the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love,
			which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall
			come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.


			The Holy Ghost

			John14: 26,27 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
			will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all
			things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
			27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world
			giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let
			it be afraid.

			John15: 26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
			the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the
			Father, he shall testify of me;

			Moroni 8:25, 26 And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism
			cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the
			fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins; 26 And the
			remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and
			because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of
			the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love,
			which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall
			come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.

			Relationship with the Savior

			John 15:4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
			itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide
			in me. 5 I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me,
			and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye
			can do nothing.
			6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
			withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
			are burned.

			Meekness and Gratitude


			Keeping the Commandments
			John15:10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I
			have kept my Father''s commandments, and abide in his love.

			Psalms 19: The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
			testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
			8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
			commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
			9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of
			the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
			10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
			sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
			11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there
			is great reward.

			The members of the Church who keep the commandments have this promise:
			"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall
			tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
			peril, or sword? . . . Nay, in all these things we are more than
			conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded" - Paul
			is speaking - "that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
			principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
			nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
			separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
			Lord" (Rom. 8:35-39.) (Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, p.
			460)

			Synonyms for God''s Love

			Joy
			JST John 15:11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might
			remain in you, and that your joy might be full.

			2Nephi2:25 Adam fell…

			Grace
			"Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of
			all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness,
			and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his
			grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in
			Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can
			in nowise deny the power of God." And again, if ye by the grace
			of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye
			sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the
			blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the
			remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot."
			Moroni10:32,33 32

			Fear
			The word "fear" seems to denote different things in different
			parts of the scriptures. Where it refers to man''s relationship
			with Diety, however, the word often suggests deep love and respect as
			opposed to terror or distrust. The basis of the word
			"fear", in any context, is subjugation or acknowledgement
			of inferiority. A person''s fear of high places, for example, is
			an acknowledgement that the consequences of a misstep from such a
			place will be beyond ones'' control. Such can be said of other
			fears or phobias-they derive from an acknowledgement of inferiority
			to a superior force, imagined or real.

			Man therefore fears God when man is humble enough to admit to himself
			that there''s a greater power in the Universe than himself. As
			inevitable as the consequences of natural laws such as gravity or
			darkness, God''s laws have consequences. The basis of our
			"fear" of God is humility. Unlike other natural laws,
			however, our understanding of heavenly laws grows from an
			understanding that they''re based on a plan to make us happy. The
			sinner may be brought to fear God as he feels remorse for his sins,
			and realizes that eternal misery awaits him as a consequence. But
			this fear, or distrust of God (as if he were an assailant) quickly
			grows within the humbled sinner''s heart as it changes to a fear,
			or love for God who has prepared a plan of repentance and forgiveness
			of sin.

			Consider King Benjamin''s great sermon to his people:

			Mosiah 5:1 "And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made
			an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the
			angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the
			multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of
			the Lord had come upon them." In this verse one could easily
			infer that the people, reminded of their own sinful ways, had fallen
			to the earth because, having seen their own filthiness, they
			literally doubted, and therefore feared, that they would be able to
			gain a celestial reward. Their fall to the ground would in this
			context have been as the victim before the assailant, trembling and
			begging for mercy.

			This thought continues in the next verse: 2 "And they had viewed
			themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the
			earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have
			mercy…" Here we might imagine our helpless, groveling victim.
			But then our perspective changes as the people explain that they have
			great hope, even knowledge, that something better awaits them:
			".and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive
			forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we
			believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and
			earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of
			men." The people, having understood God''s love for them,
			fell to the ground in full faith that they would receive a remission
			of their sins through the atoning blood of Christ.

			This being said, there''s value in rereading the first verse of
			Mosiah 5, now substituting the word "fear" with the idea of
			its intended synonym, "God''s love". We read, "And
			now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of
			speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the angel of
			the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and
			behold they had fallen to the earth, for the [love] of the Lord had
			come upon them." Perhaps the salient question is this: Do the
			Lord''s children respond more meaningfully and powerfully through
			the repellent force of a distrustful fear of their Father, or from a
			humble and respectful love of the same?

			We can substitute this word "love" for "fear" in
			many other verses of scripture. To the children of Israel, wandering
			dependently in the wilderness for 40 years, Moses asks, "And
			now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear
			the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to
			serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, To
			keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command
			thee this day for thy good?" Deut10:12,13 We note in this verse
			the juxtaposition of the commandments to both fear and love the Lord.

			Gratitude
			In his April 2002 Conference Address, Elder Gene R. Cook admonishes us:
			"Receive His [the Lord''s] love in humility. Be grateful for
			the gift and especially for the giver of the gift. True gratitude is
			the ability to humbly see, feel, and even receive love. Gratitude is
			a form of returning love to God. Recognize His hand, tell Him so,
			express your love to Him. As you come to truly know the Lord, you
			will find an intimate, sacred relationship built on trust. You will
			come to know He understands your anguish and will, in compassion,
			always respond to you in love."


			Charity
			Of all synonyms for God''s love, the most comprehensive seems to be
			the word "charity". Bruce R. McConkie explains, "Above
			all the attributes of godliness and perfection, charity is the one
			most devoutly to be desired. Charity is more than love, far more; it
			is everlasting love, perfect love, the pure love of Christ which
			endureth forever. It is love so centered in righteousness that the
			possessor has no aim or desire except for the eternal welfare of his
			own soul and for the souls of those around him. (Mormon Doctrine, p.
			121).

			Moroni 7:46 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are
			nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity,
			which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail-
			47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and
			whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with
			him.
			48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the
			energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath
			bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ;
			that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we
			shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have
			this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.

			2 Nephi 26:30 Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore,
			the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have
			charity, which charity is love. And except they should have charity
			they were nothing. Wherefore, if they should have charity they would
			not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.

			The Spirit of the Lord
			See 1 Nephi 1:12

			The Spirit of Christ
			For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know
			good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for

			Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye
			may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God. Moroni 7:16

			The Power and Gift of Christ

			Nephi 2:4)

			Fountain of Living Waters
			And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father
			had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living
			waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of
			the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a
			representation of the love of God. (1 Nephi 11:25)

			Tree of Life
			And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father

			Opposition in all things

			2Nephi2:15 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he
			had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the
			fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must
			needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in
			opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other
			bitter.

			2Nephi 2: 22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not
			have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And
			all things which were created must have remained in the same state in
			which they were after they were created; and they must have remained
			forever, and had no end.
			23 And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have
			remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no
			misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.
			Agency
			2Nephi 2: 15 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man,
			after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field
			and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created,
			it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden
			fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the
			other bitter.
			16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for
			himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be
			that he was enticed by the one or the other.

			Blessings promised to those who love God:
			After wandering 40 years in the Wilderness, Moses brought his people up to
			the edge of their promised land, and gave them instruction. The book
			of Deuteronomy, from which we read an account of these events, is a
			repetition of the Law of God. Moses reminds the people: "For the
			land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of
			Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and
			wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: But the land,
			whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and
			drinketh water of the rain of heaven: A land which the LORD thy God
			careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the
			beginning of the year even unto the end of the year. And it shall
			come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments
			which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve
			him with all your heart and with all your soul,
			That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first
			rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and
			thy wine, and thine oil." Deut11:10-15. In Egypt, the fertile
			soil and flowing river around Goshen made it relatively simple to
			care for oneself. One could simply scatter seeds on the ground, push
			them into the soil, and they would sprout. But this new generation of
			Israelities were to be humble, and were to look to the Lord for their
			support. The rain would fall because they were obedient to him. The
			daily manna of their fathers was to become the seasonal manna of rain
			and sunshine one which they would depend for their very existence.
			The faucet, as it were, to irrigate their land and make it fertile,
			was their love of God.

			Many times the Lord removes those, whom he loves, from an Egypt, where
			they''re captive to their own desires and to the strength of
			their own flesh, and he moves them to a condition wherein they must
			look to Him for their support.

			Love is knowledge, wisdom, and power

			D&C 121:45, 46 Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men,
			and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts
			unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of
			God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as
			the dews from heaven.
			46 The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an
			unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall
			be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall
			flow unto thee forever and ever.

			Miscelaneous

			As I was pondering love today, the following quote caught my attention:
			Love established in the home then extends out to the neighborhood,
			the state, the nation, and the world and has the power to bind people
			together and make them one. "Differences of language, of
			education, of race and of nationality all disappear. Under its
			influence, prejudices and animosities vanish" (Cannon, George Q.
			Gospel Truth p. 299). This comes out of the encyclopedia of Mormonism
			under "love". The reference to language is what struck me,
			and that differences of language will disappear with love. Applying
			this to the Tower of Babel I can''t help but wonder if what
			caused the collapse of the unified language was indeed the
			dissolution of love between the people. I also can''t help but
			wonder if the Adamic language is founded, not on linguistics, but on
			love. Is this where the gift of tongues derives-this Godly love? How
			else can it be explained?

			A Book of Mormon Tour of Godly Love

			This tour explores the Book of Mormon as a historical field guide, of
			sorts, into the understanding of Godly Love. Through every chapter, I
			suppose, there are references, either overtly or implied, that
			demonstrate Godly Love, or the consequences of those who choose to
			turn away from the Lord.


			1 Nephi 1:1 "I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents,
			therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and
			having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless,
			having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having
			had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God,
			therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days."

			Nephi begins his first narrative in the Book of Mormon, which becomes the
			first chapter and verse, by describing the love of parents to
			children, the importance of educating them, the reality of
			afflictions in all of our lives, and the blessings which come as we
			overcome our afflictions, having faith in God, and learning of His
			ways. It begins with open gratitude to his acknowledged Heavenly
			Father for great gifts. It begins with a Godly man, standing within
			himself, yet looking beyond himself:
			· Acknowledgement of Parents
			· Importance of education
			· Overcoming adversity
			· Gratitude to the Lord
			· Learning of the Lord
			· Importance of record keeping

			In fact, the first verse of the Book of Mormon becomes, as it were, a
			type and a shadow for the rest of the book. It also becomes a
			synopsis of what it means to experience Godly Love. This love of a
			Heavenly Father begins in the love of earthly parents who teach and
			nourish us, and moves on to how we use our earthly blessings to bless
			others.

			Within a few verses we come to understand the context of the people who
			would be known as the Nephites-a people born in a tumultuous time in
			the history of Israel-a people who would either leave to escape the
			onslaught of the Babylonians, or who would be conquered and carried
			away by them. And here we find the man Lehi, blessed by the Lord and
			prospering in earthly ways, yet focused outside of himself.

			1 Nephi 1:5. "Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as
			he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in
			behalf of his people." We''ve journeyed only 5 verses into
			the Book of Mormon and we''ve learned the order of love-God to
			his children, children to fathers, and now, man to his brother-the
			human family. It''s not enough to speak of God''s love for
			us, but rather, we must speak of God''s love in us, or through
			us-we being the mirror that immediately reflects God''s light
			onto our brethren.

			In his vision, Lehi is handed a book of scripture to read, and as he
			reads, he''s "filled with the Spirit of the Lord." (1
			Nephi 1:12). We now come upon another synonym for "God''s
			Love", which is "the Spirit of the Lord". If we
			literally accept the Biblical Pronouncement by the Apostle John that
			"God is love" (1 John 4:8), we can use the terms God and
			Love interchangeably. To say that Lehi is filled with the Spirit of
			the Lord is equal to saying he is filled with the Spirit of Love. In
			this way each person who feels the Spirit of the Lord recognizes this
			love in is/her life. John elaborates: "Beloved, let us love one
			another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of
			God, and knoweth God." (1 John 4:7) Being filled with this
			Spirit, or in other words, this Love, it''s no surprise to learn
			what Lehi does next. His heart is turned inside out, as he looks from
			self to his fellow men, and jeapordizes his life to go out and preach
			among them. His heart is filled with gratitude as he turns to the
			lord and exclaims, "Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord
			God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and
			goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and,
			because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto
			thee that they shall perish!" (1 Nephi 1:14) This godly mercy of
			which Lehi speaks is another synonym for the idea of God''s love.
			Nephi explains, "But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that
			the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath
			chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the
			power of deliverance." (1 Nephi 1:20)

			As Lehi continues to be faithful in the charge he''s received to
			warn his fellow men, we read the following: "For behold, it came
			to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and
			said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which
			thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto
			this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to
			take away thy life." 1 Nephi 2:1 This great man has put away
			personal considerations and fears (pride) to do the will of the Lord,
			and for this he''s "blessed". We may well ask, what
			does it mean to be "blessed"? Webster''s 1828
			Dictionary defines the term, in part, as "enjoying spiritual
			happiness and the favor of God; enjoying heavenly felicity".
			This definition is quite insightful. Note that the term doesn''t
			express as much what God has given his children, but rather, their
			recognition and acknowledgement of those gifts. In other words, we
			might well ask, "to whom has the Lord denied gifts that would
			bring them back to him?" What child of God is their upon this
			earth whom the Lord has denied those spiritual and temporal gifts
			that would allow him/her to return to their Heavenly Father? The
			answer, quite simply, is none. Every soul born upon this earth was
			already one of the elect-a victor in the War in Heaven. Every soul is
			born with the same destiny to return and live in a Heavenly Home,
			"For there is no respect of persons with God." Romans 2:11
			The blessed man or woman, therefore, isn''t that soul who has
			received the greatest amount from God, but rather, is that person who
			recognizes God''s gifts in his/her life. The blessed soul
			isn''t he who has received most, for we all receive according to
			our capacity to receive. The blessed soul is that which recognizes
			God''s love and His gifts.

			Consider the Beatitudes in this context (Matthew 5:3-13):
			· Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
			· Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
			· Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
			· Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for
			they shall be filled.
			· Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
			· Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
			· Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children
			of God.
			· Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness'' sake:
			for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
			· Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
			shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
			Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven:
			for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
			In each case, a person is recognized as blessed, not for something the
			Lord has given them, but for something they''ve given back to the
			Lord. In each case the person is blessed who has submitted to the
			will of the Father (is poor in spirit, mourns, is meek, hungers after
			righteousness, is merciful, pure in heart, a peacemaker, is
			persecuted for righteousness'' sake, suffers for the Lord).
			He''s blessed first for what he has submitted himself to, and
			he''s promised blessings afterwards for the consequence of his
			choice (obtains the kingdom of heaven, is comforted, inherits the
			earth, is filled, obtains mercy, sees God, is called a Child of God,
			obtains the kingdom of heaven, receives a great reward in Heaven.)
			Thus, when the Lord pronounces Lehi blessed for his selfless actions,
			we might wonder about this-he must abandon riches, and any reputation
			among men he may have had. He must leave the comfort of a luxurious
			home, and take an often-rebellious family into the wilderness to be
			deprived of a lifestyle many would argue he''d earned. But
			he''s blessed for who he is, having submitted to God''s will,
			feeling God''s love in his life. Lehi is "blessed"
			during the sacrifices he makes, because through these righteous acts
			of submission to God''s will, he feels God''s love.
			Conversely, we might add that any act of self-deprivation that
			doesn''t allow us to feel God''s love at the moment of
			submission probably isn''t a "blessing" to us.
			We''re only blessed in sacrifice as it draws us closer to God and
			allows us to feel his love for and through us.

			So Lehi draws his family together, and in willing submission to
			God''s will, leaves the comfortable life he knew, and departs
			into the wilderness. We know that some of his family has gone through
			the process to believe, and walks with him in faith. Nephi prays, and
			receives a steady answer that his father has indeed been instructed
			of the Lord. Lehi receives the vision, and Nephi confirms it through
			prayer. Then Nephi bears testimony to his brother Sam, who, through
			Nephi''s faith and testimony, gains testimony of the same. But
			Laman and Lemuel are unwilling to submit themselves-unwilling to
			believe. "And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did
			murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they knew
			not the dealings of that God who had created them." (1Nephi2:12)
			They "knew not the dealings…of God." In other words, they
			were unfamiliar with his ways, with his intercession with his
			children, and with his love for them. What faith could they possibly
			have in a being whom they hadn''t come to know. What courage
			would they be able to draw as they left all of their comforts, that
			they''d continue to be happy and watched over? For Nephi, the
			journey into the wilderness was relatively simple. His journey was
			governed by a single great principle, for he did know the dealings of
			God. He knew that at all times, and in every moment, through every
			hardship and trial, he was loved by the only being in the Universe
			who''s feelings really matter.
			We learn from the writings of the prophet Joseph Smith, that
			"Faith, then, is the first great governing principle which has
			power, dominion, and authority over all things; by it they exist, by
			it they are upheld, by it they are changed, or by it they remain,
			agreeable to the will of God." (Lectures on Faith, 1:24.) What
			is faith, then, if not the understanding that God loves us, and seeks
			the best for us? To exercise faith, then, is simply a matter of
			trust, that the Lord will seek out the best for us, and is, in all
			ways, empowered to deliver it to us. Nephi and Lehi had this faith
			through vision, Sam and Sariah had it through their willingness to be
			counseled by Lehi and Nephi. But Laman and Lemuel rejected the
			Lord''s overtures of love, and thus knew now his workings.

			For Nephi, it wasn''t sufficient to gain a testimony of the Gospel
			of Jesus Christ. He wanted to learn more. He wanted to understand the
			"mysteries of God", which I suppose, simply means those
			things that are revealed to an individual through study and prayer.
			He records, "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being
			exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also
			having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I
			did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my
			heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my
			father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my
			brothers." 1 Nephi 2:16 Why did Nephi need to soften his heart,
			and what exactly does the phrase mean? We know that the term has
			something to do with humility, and something to do with being
			teachable.

			The commandment Lehi received to leave all their worldly wealth and go
			to some unseen promised land would have been difficult to obey. But
			for his sons, the commandment to return to their former home, collect
			all of their abandoned wealth, then take it to a man they greatly
			feared in exchange for something which had little earthly value-this
			was a true test. Lehi sent his sons, Laman, Lemuel, Sam and Nephi
			back to Jerusalem to fetch the records of their fathers-a genealogy
			and scripture. In this moment Nephi provides one of the most quoted
			and illuminating verses of scripture in his simple statement,
			"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will
			go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that
			the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he
			shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which
			he commandeth them." 1 Nephi 3:7

			This simple statement, when distilled to it''s essential elements,
			states,

			I WILL BEGIN.

			When they return, it falls upon Laman to convince Laban to give them the
			plates. But Laban is angered by Laman''s suggestion, throws him
			out, and tries to have him killed. The young men consult, and Laman
			and Lemuel are certain they''ve done everything that was expected
			of them. They went back, gave it their best try, and now, they
			presume, stand guiltless before their father. But again, the young
			Nephi, in Godly wisdom, says: "But behold I said unto them that:
			As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our
			father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which
			the Lord hath commanded us." 1 Nephi 3:15

			When we distill this simple statement to its essential elements, we hear,

			I WILL ENDURE

			A new plan to take all of their precious things to exchange for the
			plates of Laban fails miserably as well, and not only is the gold and
			silver taken from them, but they''re pursued by the armies of
			Laban who have been sent to kill them. Once again Laman and Lemuel
			confront Nephi, this time striking him with a rod, and once again
			Nephi persists, "And it came to pass that I spake unto my
			brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be
			faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is
			mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his
			fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?" 1 Nephi 4:1
			It''s not enough to have tried once, or to have risked everything
			and tried again. Nephi''s statement would seem insane to anyone
			who doesn''t understand the relationship of the Lord with his
			children. But Nephi''s eye is set, not on the waves of a
			turbulent sea, as Peter was one fateful evening, but on the love of
			his God. His simple statement above concisely affirms,

			WE (the Lord through me) WILL SUCCEED.

			To feel God''s love is to understand he cannot fail us-we can only
			fail him. To have God''s love is to look beyond earthly obstacles
			and acknowledge that so long as we''re involved in His work,
			we''ll have His strength, and His protection.

			Then, in this marvelous, faithful journey to follow the will of the Lord,
			submitting all desires to the Lord, and finally, submitting all
			fears, Nephi states, "And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing
			beforehand the things which I should do." 1 Nephi 4:6. In this
			simple testimony of faith the young believer simply states,
